That is what everyone say when we ask if they prefer public transport or car .
Using public transport can be difficult , because we have a strict time and normally , we do not have a place to sit and that can be extremely uncomfortable .
Sometimes the staff go strike and we customers do not know in time . As a result , we can not get to work on time . That is one of the disadvantages of using public transport .

People usually tell me I 'm a cinema 's enthusiast , and they are right . I prefer to spend my free time watching a good film , especially when it is a thriller , rather than doing sport ,

In my opinion , public transport in my country will never improve , because my country is so poor and , besides , it is considered one of Third World countries . And another thing that must be taken into consideration is that the politicians are horrible . They have destroyed my country .

Of course , in summer , I like to exercise more than in winter , but this do n't stop me .
If it is very cold and windily outside , I do n't worry about it and I exercise at home .
For those people who want to start to do the street workout , I 'm advising to start with basic exercises such as pull ups , push ups , dips and squats .
These are all basic exercises and they will help you make a good start up .
After some time , when you will be feeling that you are ready for more , you can start to do more difficult exercises .
Sometimes , a lot of phrases and sentences run around my head , but how to write it down correctly ?

This was one of the everyday invents that affects our lives .
Edison said to have created the first commercially practical incandescent light .
Some historians claim there were 20 over inventors of incandescent lamps prior to Edison 's version , but Edison is often credited with the invention because his version was able to outstrip the earlier versions because of a combination of three factors : " an effective incandescent material , a higher vacuum than others were able to achieve and a high resistance that made power distribution from a centralized source economically viable . "
Edison began serious research into the incandescent light bulb on October of 1878 , and his original design was in 1879 .

The environment is our surroundings . There is no awareness in our locality . They are busy with their own work . No one focuses on or sees what is happening in our town . They usually speak about how hot today is?but they do n't know what makes it this hot . I am interested in planting trees and making our surroundings clean . Some people used to burn the forest as if the forest is useless . Man is greedy because all the things we get from the forests are free .

He said to the bride and groom that they should each get into an inflatable ball and try walking on the water for as long as they could , and the bride won because the groom slipped and fell after them , out of the ball , fell into the water , and kissed .

However , a few years ago , the government has paid more attention to the environment of our country . For example , they did a lot of advertisement on television , in newspapers and on the internet to explain that rubbish is not good for our world .

Some people say that a trip by car is more convenient than by public transportation , but that statement has a lot of issues if we think about the limitations .
It is true that when travel to a nearby place from your city , it is more comfortable getting there by car , because of the ease of having your car to get wherever you want without spending money and time taking cabs .
But public transport has a future for a lot of reasons . First , time . If the place you want to reach is really far , the different types of vehicles of public transport will get you there faster than your car . Also , the complications about the field , like if you want to go from America to Europe , there is no highway that crosses the ocean . You need an airplane and , unless you have one , you will not be able to achieve travel between continents with your car . A different reason is politics , because if you want to go from anywhere in the USA to Alaska , you will not need to pass through Canada . commodity is a really important reason , because driving for 8 hours is exhausting and it will also be unsafe . Economics is a factor too , because the wear and tear on your car will be more than in normal use and the price of food and extra stops that you will need to do . It will be more expensive than on public transport .

I started running because I endured neck pain and my left leg was not comfortable when I sat all day .
I bought shoes , clothes and a GPS watch . I told myself : now it is a challenge , I must defeat myself . The first day was so painful . I was tired to die when I only ran nearly 3 km , but things became better and better , and now I could run 10 km .
If you want to start running , first , you need comfortable shoes and clothes , and secondly , make a plan , like how long should I run today . Remember , appropriate rest is necessary .

They were poor ; they did n't have the necessary resources , but the husband worked so hard because his wife had had an accident . It happened one day that his wife was working on a campaign for the conservation of endangered animals . She went to a place in search of animals . She heard a sound in a dark place in the jungle , so she went to investigate what that was . A creature that had never been seen attacked her . Her partner only heard a shout and they found Lucy , the wife of the man , on the floor . They asked her if she was OK , but she did n't answer , so her partner took her to the doctor . There , the doctor said that she was OK but she would never hear again unless she paid 1 , 000 dollars for an operation .

She heard a sound in a dark place in the jungle , so she went to investigate what that was . A creature that had never been seen attacked her . Her partner only heard a shout and they found Lucy , the wife of the man , on the floor . They asked her if she was OK , but she did n't answer , so her partner took her to the doctor . There , the doctor said that she was OK but she would never hear again unless she paid 1 , 000 dollars for an operation .
One day , the son of Lucy and her husband went to carve holes in the dirt to make a game , he made five holes and in the last one he found a brilliant jewel that had belonged to generations of gods . So he started throwing that for play . One time that he took the jewel , it consumed the mind of the little guy and that made the jewel emit some sounds that only giants could hear , so a mountain stood up that was the face of a giant and he perceived negative vibes , so he killed the guy because he had the most important relic of the gods .

It is very easy to spend hours getting entertained by television .
However , it is more difficult to educate .
How could I do this mistake ! !
These were my first feeling when I made the mistake .
Furthermore , the student and tutors should be encouraged to use public transport , cycling or walking .
Finally , all the student should be taught about the environment .
I hope I find the answers to your question in my letter .
Firstly , people who prefer youth culture , I recommend Hongdae .
There are a lot of clubs , pub and bars , cafes , and karaoke , bars and it has more facilities which you will be able to enjoy .

Hongdae has many kinds of places thus , but you will be concerned about drunk people late at night .
At the late night in Hongdae , lots of people drink with their friends and walk around the streets in a drunken condition .
Late at night in Hongdae , lots of people drink with their friends and walk around the street in a drunken condition .
So you need to be careful those kinds of people .
And then , let me tell you another place , ' Duksu Palace '
. You can experience 19th century Korean imperial architecture and Korean traditional custom .
The palace is in the middle of the city , so you may feel the different mood between the 19th century and today .
Have you ever been to climb mountains ? That is incredible and amazing . Do you like your school ? your city ?
My school is fine and I like my country better than yours ; our teams are better than your . England are the worst at football , Argentina rules .
England do n't have anything . You are the worst and most horrible country in the universe .
For sure , I will apply those strategies in my professional life , because drama gives students the opportunity of not just learning something in the classroom . More than that , it is the opportunity that use their knowledge in educational and social life .

I choose the wheel because is the most useful invention ever because , thanks to it , human work is made easier , for example a way to move heavy objects , compared to some of the fancy gadgets that we have today . The wheel was invented at a relatively late point in human history ; the oldest known wheel found in an archaeological excavation is from Mesopotamia .

You can think , ' why is that ? '
It 's very simply .
I think it is a strong language , maybe a bit hard to listen to , but beautiful at the end .
Added to what I know , that make it attractive .
To this , we have to add the food and drink ( who do n't think this ? ) .
Except strange cases , who does n't want to try the authentic German beer , or the Frankfurter sausages in the place where they were invented ?
Apart from strange cases , who does n't want to try the authentic German beer , or the Frankfurt sausages in the place where they were invented ?

The members follow you , and you can based on them . You can tell whatever you want to them .

In recent years , was improved the public transport system .
It was presented a politician , an economist and two environmentalists .
These people , those live in a city , do not take their own car or do not have one .
So , there will be problems of these habits .
So there will following more traffic jams if we do not change our habits .
So will be more traffic jams if we do not change our habits .
The results will be the pollution of the environment .
So , we will stop traffic jam and as a consequence the environmental problems .
But now we need more buses or another faster public transport systems .
Teens should not drink under the legal drinking age because they could get into trouble with the law , they could cause harm themselves and others and could have a higher risk of alcohol dependency later in their lives .

I started this sport when I was 10 years old . where My father was also playing this sport , but he started it when he was older than me . He was about 30 years old . where Squash is one of those games that can be played at any age . I love this game because I find it exercises the whole body in the same time . We run in a small space , moving our hands in stretched and different ways , and at the same time we work our minds , so it needs care and quick thinking , as much any as exercise you will find down the road .

Then , sheets of bank notes would be printed 50 bank notes per sheet , which have colour images on both sides in special ink .
It was the most important step during the whole processing .
And then , some sheets and good bank notes from damaged sheets which would be cut into individual bank notes and separated into equal ones and packed and despatched to where they are needed .
Other ones , which are bad sheets and bad bank notes , which are damaged apparently , be destroyed securely .
This was the whole working process of the bank notes and it consists of 7 steps .

But if the prices will be too high , no one will visit the games anymore .

Positive things about online learning are that you are more mobile with your smartphone and you do n't have to carry so much paper with you . Also , your on your own and at your own learning speed , which makes it more specific to the user themself . Maybe you 're more comfortable on your Smartphone than with paper .

Negatives about online learning are that you 're not listening to much from a real person and more from a Computer . If pyou do n't have any listening things in the app you do n't learn how to pronounce the words . In my personal obinionits better to learn from a teacher not only because you learn to pronounce the words correctly , but you also learn from a person , which is , in my opinion , way better . I think we spend enough time on smartphones , so I do n't think it 's the best if we use them to learn as well .
I love Grey 's Anatomy . This is supposed to be a medical drama , but I am sure this show has been beloved because of the soap opera drama parts .

Advertisement is important for the economy .
Exept some good movies , they also show a lot of rubbish .
Or sometimes during the day you see horror movies which should not be .
Who wants their child to see this ?

Attitude about schools in Colombia and Australia .
The attitude of Colombians to the educations system is disappointing in some areas and optimistic in others .
This is because in Colombia there are a lot of socio - economic levels , which makes people have a different and divided attitudes toward education .

Recently , there is a growing country whose environment is destroyed by building house , which accour for some debate .
With the tremendous thriving and growth of both the economy and cultural diversity , the need is increasing of resource which are used for building much - needed housing and transport networks .
What is worse , the room taken up by the house is where some animals lived before , so they lost their homes , which become the houses of people . Nevertheless , the earth does not only belong to the human race .

What is worse , the space taken up by the house is where some animals lived before , so they lost their homes , which become the houses of people . Nevertheless , the earth does not only belonged to the human race .
Secondly , building more houses is not so much because of living by people , but more because of the economy , which is used for building speculation and the price of the house is too expensive for the ordinary person .
For example , some people who have lots of money living in Shenzhen earn more money by buying at a low price and selling at a high price , although they have a house to live .
For example , some people who have lots of money living in Shenzhen earn more money by buying at a low price and selling at a high price , although they have house to live in .
Therefore , no longer on the acts go unheeded , and the governments have to deal with these problems . We should forbid the acts by imposing certain law .
In a word , the government may appeal to people in some way , that we should protect the earth rather than only focus on personal profit .
I will use public transport , not always , but more than the car , although you travel slower , because I want to save our planet that the coming generations can live in good conditions .
Tennis is not a coletive sport .
There are just two players and if you get tired and lose a match no one is going to be responsible but yourself .
Sometimes it is difficult to join so many people to practise a team sport .
Undercontrary , for a tennis match you need just one , and it does n't matter if it is a man or a woman .
For example , never starts a match without a warm up , because you can suffer serious muscular injury .
In spite of the risks , I recommend this sport to everyone who is in good physical condition .

So I decided to learn swim for the summer vacation .

Firstly , we are having different modes of transport , among these is road transport .

Secondly , if private transportation is increasing faster , traffic is also going to create a major problem , which causes the global warming .
And the income that is gained through this transport service will automatically decrease , which will create a problem for the economy of the government .
More unemployed people may also lead to a crime rate .
I hope giving equal priority for both public and private transportation makes us healthy .

At the time , we need more cars for more people . That 's the cause of more traffic .
It 's for this reason that I think the public transport is a great benefit to society , and a good way for us to move from one place to another . I suggest that the government should invest more money for the purpose of improving public transport .

The big deal is entertaining , and quality is part of it .
Keep in mind what you should do before buying your own dreaming TV .
However , people nowadays look for a good design and not for quality . The big problem is that price is against quality , even though a good designing of TV series on well - known stores is the big option that we can choose to check .
Consider a good price and good quality by checking and visiting stores . You should not spend too much money by buying the biggest TV , you can save money by only watching a few minutes in stores , take your sit , enjoy and list if you are convinced .
In conclusion , enjoy watching movies on your own TV considering price and quality . Some TV brings you the experience to enjoying your favourite movies in other scenery . Will you try ?

One of the things we do is to do maintenance every week to the vegetation zone , checking if there is any garbage . To avoid this , we teach the younger generation environmentalist actions so they do n't throw cans , paper , or candies on the floor . They can also help the older people . There are cases where a person throws garbage on the street or on the vegetation . To avoid that happening again , we have a punishment that is to pay some money . If they do n't , they wo n't be allowed to enter the village park and zoo again , unless they were visitors .

My first night was easy because I only watched the screen and pass from camera to camera and nothing strange happened . I could only hear footsteps and noises .
My second and third nights were very strange because in the cameras the animatronics moved as if they wanted to get to my room and do something to me .

If you have a car , you probably think that travelling by car is better than by bus , but there are a lot of people who do n't have a car , so they are used to go by bus and , for them , this way of travelling has become more convenient , because they have done it since they were children .

Therefore , whatever opinion you have is the result of the social situation in what you live .
Most people say that using public transport is better than using cars , and they say that it 's cheaper and better for the environment . As for me , I think that cars are easier and an affordable way to travel between places , because cars are here anytime and so near to your home , unlike public transportation , which you have to walk to to reach in most countries . And also , cars are available all the time . You can go at 4 am and no one will say anything , because it 's yours , but most public transportation is available only for the daylight hours and a few hours at night , in emergency situation for example , what will you do if you do not have your own car ? Your kid is sick , or your wife or your elderly parents . And , in general , the more we rely on ourselves , the more our government is able to help the poor and homeless people out there , who really need more help and aid from the public community . We merely ask the government to improve the streets and the traffic light systems , and more petrol stations and parking in the streets , to be able to drive and move around easily and safely and in a short amount of time .

Everyone use public transport every day .
It is difficult to imagine how we can live without it .
Most people said that using a car is more convenient than using public transport .
The film is based on a girl . She is invited to many weddings and she is a maid of honor at all of them .

The main characters are very younger and enjoyable .
Almost every family have more than one car .
As a result , roads are overloaded and long traffic jams damage air .
On the one hand , that quantity of cars ca n't be forbidden , because it 's a personal right to have it or not .
For example , introducing severals special dates in a year for using only public transport .
Factories damage nearby areas and water extremely bad .
Secondly , rules for tourists about caring for the environment must be very strick .
I think nature will get the most important benefits if everybody takes care of own space in the best way .
Sports is a unique way by which a person can maintain his or her health , including both aspects that are physical and mental .
The different formats of cricket allow me to maintain my health based on the time available after earning my daily bread and it is needless to say , after sharing precious moments with my lovely family .

I often participate in friendly matches to keep physical abilities up to the mark .
While putting a lot of stress on physical abilities , it goes without saying that the day can be tiring if one decides to play the longer version of the game , but it is equally challenging as to how you will keep up your mantle status .

I work as a teacher for ten years .
I really love take care of myself , and so , last year I decided to go walking every day in the evening .
I love walking near the arbour of my city , so I can have a look at the beautiful sea ! when I walk I feel the clean wind , and so , I take deep breaths .
I suggest everybody should have the same evening walking . You just need a pair of comfortable shoes !
The main reason for people not like to travel by public transport is overcrowding .
Travel by train is very expensive nowadays .

Beijing is the capital of China , it is the political , economical and cultural center , but also a city with a long history .
It was the capital of Ming dynasty and Qing dynasty , so it has a lot of ancient architecture , like Ming Tombs , the Summer Palace , The Temple of Heaven , the Forbidden City .
It is more than thousands of mails long .
When we talk about convenience , comfort and safety , then private transport is more likely to consider .
In certain emergency cases , running for a bus seems harder than jumping up into your own car .

Shopping takes place the biggest part especially for women , but sometime it is not so enjoyable and I agree with this statement .
First of all , shopping is not satisfying when you are tired , or you are hungry , or maybe it is just your personality who does n't like crowds of people walking around .

After some ages we can not attend any this type of activity because we are all old . So let go and enjoy your youth and be happier .

In the big cities , they have began to build green buildings , they use electric public transport in order not to pollute .
In my opinion , there may be many rules , but if we do n't respect it , we will not help our habitat .

I was the babysitter of these children for all that summer and I enjoyed myself so much with them .
They lived in a big house with a lovely swimming pool where we can swim and play .
This experience helped me a lot because I became much more responsible , not only with those boys , but also with my brothers and sister ( I have two brothers and one sister ) and I learned the meaning to working and earning money .

However , we were lucky enough to have a great mother who tried all her best to support my older brother , my older sister and me in completing our college studies . Of course , my uncle , younger brother of my mother lent a big hand to go through the hard times , so that made us often help each other in my family when a member was in difficulty .

That was really the biggest harm to a hard - working woman like my mother who tried her best to feed me up and help me complete my studies .
All the members of my family never give up on me , and I finished my college studies , too . I have a good job now .
I do really thank my mother and all the members of my family for being patient and exertion to me . Now we have a great relationship with each other and treasure the happiness we have got not so easy .

First of all , let me to introduce my town . I live in Kabul , the capital of Afghanistan .
This town is located in the central zone of the Afghanistan with 4462(km² ) surface area , and has more than seven million inhabitants . The economic and security situation is not suitable and these factors have a direct effect on how we care for the environment .

Dear mr / ms
I am interested in work with you .

I love be with them ; they help me to do my work , they teach me to be a better person . I have more patience now and I know how to be happy .
I live alone , so I always cook my food .
I think that I am the person for your job because I have all that you are looking for .
And , either do I. I also like sports .
One of them which I like most is badminton .
Second , playing badminton can active your whole body , like hands , arms , feet .
play it with someone , whether just for fun or for a competition , my body will feel so hot in thirty minutes .
Then , it can play indoors , and it can be played in the sun .
Then , it can be played indoor , and it can be played in the sun .
Then , it can be played indoors , and it can play in the sun .
of fun and you can play with family or friend happily .
If someone asked me what the best sport is , I will say :
My favourite sport is badminton because I used to practise it when I was a child and I loved it .
It seems to me a complete sport , because you can practise it in pairs or in an individual way .
You have to be able to play for a long time , analyze your opponent 's mistakes to win and to have the measure of your energy so as not to be exhausted before the match is over .
For someone who is starting this sport I would give just one piece of advise : enjoy yourself .
Because if you are trying to win , you will lose the most important thing : discovering how wonderful to play a sport can be .

As we know , public transportation is not a direct way to get to all our destinations and it forces us to stop in many stops first . Moreover we have to take another one to reach our destination , so it is already obvious why using a car is better .

Secondly , public transportation is usually very crowded and make us not feel safe , since there is an opportunity for us to be robbed .
For these reasons , it can not be doubted that people think a car is more comfortable to be used rather than public transportation .

Everyday , I have to clean our room , wash clothes . I have to spend a lot of time to finishing everything before I start studying .

However , university life have many conveniences .
Before I want to pay for something , I always think carefully whether it 's really necessary or not .
Sometimes , I nearly ran out of money and I was really worried , so I have to pay money sensibly .
Living alone , I have to save money , because there are many situations which I have to deal with without family , and you can become a good person with many good characteristics , such as confidence , independent , friendliness .

I think that public transport has a future . Indeed , travel in a car is much more comfortable , because you do n't have to walk to take a bus or the underground .
But there 's a thing . No one have enough money to buy a car or maybe two . That 's why there are a lot of people who prefer public transport .
Perhaps in a future public transport could be more comfortable for the rest of the people who do n't have a car .

I read your e - mail , so let 's talk about books ! I usually read a book in my free time , because I prefer stories than short articles .
Recently , I read four great books about Shoah . They were very interesting . My favourite was : " The Book Thief " . I read it for school , but I have already seen the film of this book .

I love the fact that in this book there are a lot of German words , so I could also improve my German ( I go to the languages high school ) .

Then we set for Dhaka .
When we talked to our seniors , I think I had to control myself though they talked unreal things .
They prefer industrialization over nature .
A neverending argument took places and thus we reached Dhaka .

You can have some other choices , for example , you can stop to buy something : water , juice or a snack if you get hungry your journey or thirsty .

We began to solve it again and it took us the whole week to finish it .
While doing the puzzle , I decided to count how many pieces was left . After counting them , I realized that five pieces were missing .
I was so angry , because I was finishing the puzzle and five pieces were missing . So I began to search the whole house for the five pieces but did n't find it .

Vesuvius - this is the volcano 's name - covered it with a lot of ash so that walls , houses , food , clothes , bodies of citizens has been preserved as they were .
There is an unique atmosphere !
In my opinion , no one could n't come to Italy without visiting Pompei .
In particular , in urban , for example , Taipei city in Taiwan .
People who live there know the convenient public transport system called MRT ; it 's fast , cheaper and do n't have to find a parking space .

But , if you live in the country , a car may be essential , because it will cost so much money to buy the tickets if the family have many people .
So , I think the government should have to draw a proposal to solve the problems between the use for urban areas and countryside .
And think deeply the problem of protecting the environment .
I love my small family .
If any problems arise , i I went to my parents and tell them the problem , and they solve the problem .

Most people like to have their own car , because they think it is more comfortable and flex .
But I think that the future is the public transport . We need to preserve the environment , this is an imperative for our world , and the solution is to take the point that the governments invest more in public transport , so people do n't need to get a car to be able to have a job and do n't need it for the normal development of their lives .

Also , we have to promote people getting jobs close to their accommodation or getting accommodation close to their jobs , because we have too much pollution .

As soon as I have sat all exams , I will travel .
It became a big problem now .
However , I am stopped recent tragic developments in foreign countries .
I think it 's better and safer to go to Black Sea , to Crimea or to Kuakas .
It 's possible I will join them , because I have never been to Sochi and everyone should visit this wonder city once in their life .
I suppose I would have to say , in Japan , Sumo is my favorite sport for watching .
I have to start saying that I never imagine swimming as my favorite sport , because until my back injury , I did other sports . I mostly like extreme sports like downhill skiing , skateboarding , martial arts like Aikido , jiujitsu or ninjutsu , but because of my injury I had to start swimming and now I love it .

I strongly believe that grammar is not the most important element to speaking English . If you know grammar , you only know certain rules for writing , but I think that speaking is more important than writing , because when you go to any place in the world , you have to be prepared to talk and understand whatever they say to you . In this part you may notice that if you do n't know vocabulary , you wo n't understand anything . But here is another topic . Whether you understand or not , you have to notice the way that people talk to you , and try to understand what the person is trying to say .

If more skateboarded users are willing to go to Central Plaza , there are more customers to help the growth of business .
It is contrary to the author 's assertion .
From this point view , the decrease in business should be caused by other factors , but not skateboard users .

Second , the author claimed that the sanitation problem caused by skateboarded users is not only happen by specific person , whenever more customers should bring more waste and wrongdoing .
Those problems suggest that there are not sufficient security in Central Plaza .
To solve this problem , the city should set up more space and facilities for skateboarding , and separate the different space for walking and skateboarding .
In contact author 's concerns , the increasing skateboarded users would bring more potential to improve business in Central Plaza .
To strengthen the author 's conclusion , the author should put the factors above in the argument .

The Scorch Trials is one of the best films and thrillers that I have ever seen .

One of the most amazing parts of the film is when Teresa calls Cruel to go for them and take them again to the Cruel building , and like all of them , does n't want to go with them .

And what I really want to see in the next film is whether Thomas is mad at Teresa ( I never liked her ) and if they get free and the world goes back to normal .

Walter Mitty , in contrast , deals with the fictional story of the main character , an archivist , whose life will been changed completely when the company he works for is taken over by one of its competitors .
I must say that The Secret dream of Walter Mitty is a well - constructed movie that I strongly recommend to anyone who wants to spend a great evening watching an entertaining movie .

It can be argued that public transport systems has been losing their popularity in many ways .
This may cause people in get to their particular destination late .

We can see that people become famous when they die , so , journalists are instrumental in create a negative or positive opinion of that person .
The difficulty to learning something .
Some people said that the world could be better if it returned to the past where life was more simple .
It 's impossible to stop the science .
The question is whether older people are disadvantage by not using technology in a confident way .
One can not ignore that it 's more easy for young people to improve their knowledge than for older people .
One can not ignore that it 's easier for young people to improve their knowledge than older people .
It depends on the capacity of children to learn more fast than elderly adults .
There are no doubt : young people use technology much more easily than old people .
By the way , in my opinion , if someone , for example , explain well and calmly the use of new technology to an old man or woman , in the end , these people are also in a position to use it .

New technology consists , for instance , in smartphones , tablet , PCs .
There are some old people who are interested to knowing how technology works , but others who are not interested at all .
To conclude , if it 's true that not all people use technology confidently , anyone who is interested can be involved in using new technology even if the final results could be lower than their expectations .
Dear Sir/ Madam ( director the film department )
I am writing this letter , because last week I read a notice in your STUDENT FILM CLUB magazine about a movie or thriller that I like and I can recommend you .
Well , last Sunday , I went to the cinema and I saw THE TITANIC . Perhaps the movie counts us the typical story where the rich girl falls in love with the poor boy .
But the best of all for me was the sinking of the ship , when it went down to bottom of the ocean .
The film explains us how the event happened in the same way that it did in the early XIX century .
The director wanted to make the story as realistic possible .
He explains the building of the ship , why it sank , how it stood on the bottom the ocean and how the people helped each other .
I really like the beginning of the movie , because we can see the ship when it was really new , with its chairs , table and other furniture .

Although using your own car is better for moving around the city , public transport has been shown to be a good option for travelling lost distances at a low cost and , depending on its quality , also low budget .
There probably is n't a bright future for public transport if it does n't develop as it should in the world we are living today . That is , if businesses continue with their current already old - fashioned business model , for sure , they will lose customers , and so , benefits and weight in the transportation world .
Those improvements may include lowering the price , reducing the times or offering new destinations and more resources .
However , almost every student confessed having felt homesick despite the fact that they made a large number of friends there .
There are few things which I am very keen and passionate about in the whole world .
There are a few things which I am very keen and passionate of in the whole world .
This is not just a sport , but an extraordinary thing I do in the ordinary life , in everyday life .
When I am tired , stressed , depressed , frustrating , sick of passing fancies or fake friends , there is just one thing that is able to make me feel better and snap out of it : this is , of course , swimming .
It is worth saying each one should follow their passions .
I 'll finish saying that , even when I was young , if my father had asked me if I would rather go to a swimming race or to a candy fair , I would surely have chosen the former .
We ca n't avoid electromagnetic waves around us , even if we were living in the country or far from the factories .
If you do not have enough time for exercise every day , you can make little efforts : do not use the lift , use the stairs or walk every time you can .
Nowadays , we have hurries lives but we must stop and live our lives too .
Your health needs calm , friendship , happiness ... You must keep in contact with your friends and to spend time with yourself ( do not forget your hobbies and learn new things ) and your family .
I think it would be the best advice .

This building is situated in Barcelona , although it 's only a short walk from Gaudi 's magnificent artwork , it is n't as famous as them .
Particularly in Barcelona , the trouble was that they could fish on the sea but there was n't an appropriate place to keep the fish , so they could n't eat it one or two days later .
A group of fishermen began to walk around the city looking for a good place where they would have take their fish .
Finally , they found an old destroyed palace and they decided to build there their own " fish 's shopping centre " .
This is a great example of how the Spanish population could go on with their lives working together without government 's help .
He was dreaming it was his time to go fishing ; he went so far that he saw a kind of battle between sharks and whales .
The fish where going to the beach where the people fished .
The fish were going to the beach were the people fished .
That was his entire dream . He was now scared to know if that was real or not .
But it was too illogical to be true ; the good thing was that he was n't the one that would go and fish , which will be the leader .
They would notice quickly because the fish will smell worse than it already did .
When he woke up from his dream , kind of having a skeptic attitude , but he was diminishing it .
After walking for a lot of days , the ' survivors ' were worried , and thinking about how much they would still need to walk to find a city . Also they were thinking that maybe they were going forward one day and backwards the next day .
You start live on your own , make your own decisions and plan your future .
They do n't know which university and field of studying choose .
Besides , there are a great number of people who graduated school but do n't have enough money to continue their education .
The year off gives the opportunities to get a job .
In the beginning , it would be a simply and without high wages , but you would get some experience .
It is also a point that if you do n't execute what you wanted to during the gap year , you are in the same place as when you were graduating school .

that look occupied Micheal 's mind then on and led to him dropping his dream of being a creative engineer and abbreviated it all on his muscles and girls hoping that he might be noticed by her .

The waiting time is minimum ; you get a train every 3 to 5 minutes .
The fare of a metro train is almost equal to the other means of transport .
The only flaw of metro service is its unavailability in remote areas .
After a few kilometer , you will find a bus stop , but metro stations are built only in major areas .
Not everyone can afford a car , so public transport would be here in the future as well , but fewer people will use it .

The only difference is that they use different resources to keep in touch , such as emails and messages , instead of writing letters , which took much time to arrive .
There is a strong argument for believing these resources can harm their writing skills .
Generally , young people do n't have any problem with posting their personal photos on the Internet .
In conclusion , I think that social networks can constitute a big problem , especially for people who are not aware of what dangerous there are on the internet .

In addition , many of the educational programs are not transmitted by broadcast television and people without cable system have no access to these .

In my opinion , although there are some advantages if teachers were responsible for this task , I believe that the government is more suitable to lead this mission .

Secondly , teacher can select subjects that are more useful for local culture .

Accordingly , the first one considers whether the industry has been affected by file sharing , whereas the second analyses the live performance success in the present technological era .
The first text asserts that file sharing benefits new artists and offers listeners a wide choice of styles , despite the fact it is believed that file sharing is detrimental to the music industry .
The second text assesses the attraction of concerts despite the present high quality of recorded music , and suggests that the reasons to the success may be the communal experience and its offer of different songs and performances that make the live performance an unforgettable experience .
Regarding file sharing , in my view , the music industry should adapt to new technologies and habits of users .

In the present - day society , sustainable development is of paramount importance as our environment is being destroyed at a fast rate .
All in all , public transport should be an indispensable part of our future plan , because we have to protect our beautiful environment . Travelling by cars , although much more convenient , is never a clever choice for the betterment of our future society because of serious environmental issues .
If everyone started using a car for traveling , there would n't be enough road to everyone as there are seven billion people in the world , and even for the environment it is better to use cars as little as possible .
The government and public body should start thinking about it , and to save society public transport is best .
I can understand the use of public transport is decreasing now a day , but there is still a future for it .
So , in summary , to save the environment , to make the roads accessible to everyone , public transport should have been used and we should all try to educate people about the importance of public transport .

I do not know if there is a filter for president candidates . I just know that the ballots are counted by states .
There are different number of residents in different states , but it uses the states to represent the residents . I do not think the election is fair enough for the US to ask for " real democracy " for Hong Kong .

Let us look at counties that the US introduced " democracy " to .
Egypt , Iraq , Libya , Syria . There were chaos instead of " democracy " everywhere , and the next might be Hong Kong .
I am afraid that Occupying Central will lead to chaos similar to Tunisian Revolution .
The signature collection by the White House now ended .
I really hope Hong Kongers that signed the website will think again what they were doing and how harmful it is to China .

As might have been expected , a main city like Pamplona is well equipped to deal with a large number of tourists and residents going shopping .
Although most tourists come to Pamplona for the famous festival of " Bulls Running on the street " , many become passionate about the cuisine of Navarra . As a result , a few shops such as " LA VINOTECA " and " DELICIUS " have dedicated to selling selected top wines and typical food .
Moreover , a store known as " KUXUMUSU " offers all kinds of bulls - related souvenirs and genuine pieces that explain the Basque Country 's culture .
I would strongly recommend that any tourist , no matter their interest , should visit the aforementioned special shops .
Famous people should realize that if they try to gain famous all the time and waste their time on it , they will not have their own private life .
So , big names try to go somewhere without guards , without make - up to show themselves , to cause some juicy gossip about them , to gain famous in the easiest way .
To sum up , fame is ambivalent and people who want to be famous should realize it before become a star .

On the other hand , huge technological improvements in car features like self - driving , electrical engines , solar power and others , have created a new perspective of conceiving the way we interact with cars .
Usually , cars need one hundred percent of our attention during driving . This is a huge disadvantage of cars compared to public transport because we are not able to enjoy driving time by doing something else at the same time we are driving .
However , that is really close to being changed by Google 's Self - Drive Car , which is a new technology able to drive a car to any destination without humane intervention .

I am really happy you write to me for some advice and I am very honoured that you want to spend some time in my country .
Firstly , you have to decide if you want to visit the north or the south part of Italy , because if you do a full immersion tour of the entire Peninsula you will visit only half of all you have to visit .
If you decide to visit the north part , I think would be good if you started from Trento and its new museum of nature called Muse .
It is very beautiful because it is structured like a mountain ( and so you can start from the last floor and then you go down , visiting other floors ) .
There you must see the center of the city because we have the Dome ( the cathedral ) , the gallery near the Dome , the little hidden church called S.Satiro and , at the end , the Sforza 's castle .
If you like Egyptian history , you can go to Turin , where you can find a huge and beautiful museum about Ancient Egypt .
If you are a little bit tired of all this touring , you can go to Sicily , where a beautiful and special landscape welcome you .

Personally , I disagree with the view that money is the most important consideration for deciding a job , because there are several equally important factors .
Working in a company which is built up good core values and has an excellent reputation could easily bring fulfillment and sustain passion for your job for a long time .
Having a kind boss or friendly colleagues , for example , can bring workers a senses of belonging and enjoyment from working , hence the quality of work may increase greatly .
For example , the cost of food , drinks and commodities needs the support of the steady income .
In addition , in the life - long consideration , health - care will be increasingly important with people getting older . Hence having enough money as a stable income could not be disregarded .

In my case , I really like doing spinning . I use to do it only twice per week but now I do that any time I can .
I think that , in particular , spinning is a hard sport activity because when you have spent approximately 1 hour on your bike you 'll probably feel tired .
If you want to lose weight , this type of sport is perfect because it belongs into the aerobic exercises to burn the calories that we get eating fast food , whereas it is suitable for people that only do exercise for entertainment .

The wasted time also should weight in , whether it is waiting for the trains , or waiting for the delayed buses , not to mention the longer time it takes compared to travelling in a car .
All in all , public transport is not as fast as a car can be , it 's not as convenient as a car can provide , so its future is in doubt .

But are these newcomers will be replaced by public transport ?

For this reason , school of English are opening in all the big cities as well as in most towns .
In fact , usually there is just one class per week , and it is not enough without studying by itself during the week .
Studying English abroad is the better alternative , but it have advantages and disadvantages .
On the one hand , living abroad will probably not be cheap , so it could be necessary to find a job , but it would be an advantage at the same time : working with English people would help you improve your speaking and listening quickly .
So , probably , if you have the opportunity to stay abroad several months , you should do it , to learn English and live a different experience .
Another advantage is that you will find most of the shops you can find in the city centre but you wo n't get lost while you search them .
For all of you who have kids , you will also be interested in the different areas which take care of them for free as much time as you need .
In conclusion , you will save time , money and a foot ache . So accept my advice and try to enjoy the rest of your time of the city .

The topic of the two passages is about future use of hydroger - based fuel - cell engine .
The article states that the most efficient replacement for internal - combustion engines will be fuel - cell engines , because of their various advantages , while the reader refutes this point by stating hydrogen does not have so many advantages .
She adds that it is not directly usable , because hydrogen should be obtained in a pure liquid state , which technologically is very hard to be kept under -200 degrees Celsius .
The professor contradicts the idea by saying that will not solve the pollution problem , because it requires to be purified in order to be used .
Finally , the article says that the use of hydrogen is highly economic , because it requires only half of the energy of internal - combustion - powered cars .
The professor says that the claims is untrue , because the material from which the cells are produced is very expensive .
She explains platinum is very hard to find and , without this metal , it is impossible to produce hydrogen .

Take genetic engineering as an example . On the one hand , it helps farmers to produce more crops and meats ; on the other , it makes people believe that scientists can help in finding more efficient ways in producing more crops and poultry in the future , resulting in an unprecedented increase in the human population , which brings pollution to the environment .

In this fast - moving world , shopping is one of the most important things , but I strongly believed it is not always enjoyable .
First , shopping complexes are full of branches of big chain - stores , so this can be boring to walk through them for a long time .
Second , if you ca n't control your shopping habits , you will buy more and more things you do n't need , so that you can have a problem with your budget .
In my opinion , there is the reason that shopping is not always enjoyable and full of pleasure .

Visiting museums is an essential parts of their travel to new places for many people .
Besides seeing touristic or historical places and attending open - air activities , people also want to see the museums of the city they visited .
First of all , people visit museums to learn the history of the city being visited . We know that museums are generally established to expose special and unique belongings which are historically valuable as well as to exhibit modern belongings .
Some of them were made in modern style and some of them in the classic .
You can get an idea the culture of the city from these paintings .
Besides historic and cultural characters , some museums also can be source of fun , including attractive activities .
If you are bored with seeing classical museums , you can go to thematic museums such as natural history museum .

I ca n't agree with a statement that there is no future for public transport .
Today plenty of ecology organisations are trying to raise people 's awareness of the environment damage .
They say it is caused by burning oil , so the society demands itself to enclose it .
Increasingly , people prefer to use public transport rather than to drive a car for these reasons .
The importance of the internet on our lives
There had been some positive and negative effects on the possibilities to study and on social life .
The internet is becoming important for our study because of the availability of information sources .
Almost everybody have at this moment at least one account on a social media network like Facebook or LinkedIn .
I think we should use the internet carefully and keep use it with caution .
In my life there are so many sports I like to but there is one in particular that I love so much .
When I was young I saw my father watching football programmes every day but I did n't understand what it was .
However , over time I began to understand how to play and I liked it much more than the past .
In fact , when I was sixteen years old , I begun to go to the stadium with my friends every Sunday .
In Italy , football is the most followed sports , specially in my town where the most important player in the world played : Diego Armando Maradona .
He wins two national championships and also an important European competition .
Every day in my town , people speak only about football because it can give you a lot of emotions .

Is it best for the pollution and environment ?
In the morning , everyone goes to their job by car , but I think that the real reason to doing this is that we need to do a lot of things during the day and with public transport we spend more time than doing the same with our own vehicle .

First of all , as we said before , people 's lives have changed due to two important elements , which are the technological improvements and changes in society .
The first one is very obvious because , every day , researchers are discovering new things and improving the scientific knowledge that allows us to create new invents and improve the old ones .
For instance , one hundred years ago , it was impossible to see a woman working and supporting the whole family alone financially , or studying a degree at university , things that today are very usual and well accepted in our society .

Grass hockey is a popular sport played by people of all ages and it 's played more in countries like Britain , Argentina or Germany , than Spain or Italy .
This sport consist of beating the rival by scoring as many goals as possible .
In my opinion , grass hockey is the best sport you can play as it requires you to be really focused on to hit the ball correctly .
Besides , when you practise it , you must move your whole body , because you have to run and guide the ball over the field .

For the above reasons , I suspect that the share of public transport do n't decrease , but will rather increase in the future .

The latent form of fingerprint is invisible to the human eye , hence the need some methods for visualization and development of latent fingerprints .
Divergent approaches are used on routine basis for the development of latent fingerprints .
Powders , by adhering physically to the fingerprint residue develop the latent fingerprint . Chemical reagents undergo reactions with the organic and inorganic parts of the fingerprints . Developing the latent , small particle reagent developed latent fingerprints by adhesion to sebaceous content of the fingerprints , ninhydrin reacting with amino acid of the fingerprint and developed the latent marks . Single and multi - metal deposition methods work on the principle of deposition and result in the negative development of latent marks .

As a result , they will not make enough money to afford their livings in urban areas and will even face problems of poverty .
Meanwhile , wild animals which take forests and wetlands as their habitats will lose their homes and find it difficult to survive in jungles of concrete . Endangered animals will be harder to find after the destruction of their homelands .
Meanwhile , wild animals which have forests and wetlands as their habitats will lose their homes and find it difficult to survive in jungles of concrete . Endangered animals will be harder to be found after the destruction of their homelands .
Also , there will be no fresh grass and grains for domestic animals , such as cows , lamps , chickens to be fed .
Meanwhile , they need to build nature reserves for wild animals which can not easily find other habitats to live .
It give me pleasure and is fun .

What 's a description of a famous person ?
Most of the people know a lot about him .
So do n't tell me that famous people do n't enjoy being on the first page of the newspaper or any other magazine .
The personal space in their life should be larger than in a movie stars , but they should make their decisions transparent for most of the population though .
It is their job to make decisions that ensure the benefit of the people in their country , but we do n't need to know nothing else about them , after they come home to spend some time with their families .
We frequently discussed various hard problems in the scope of the course , and I was impressed by his analytical abilities .
He showed up a distinct intellectual level compared to other students .
I believe that Mr. Kadeer will perform very well and I strongly recommend him for the " Google Student Ambassador MENA Program " .
One day while he was all alone at home , he thought of calling the fire force and lied and pretended his house was on fire .
People gathered around his house hearing him screaming out loud and within no time the fire force also arrived at the destination .
His parents scolded him and made him make a promise to them that he wo n't lie ever in his life again .
This film was about how the previous robbery which had been committed by Vin 's gang leads to the hatred of a criminal played by Jason Statham .

The chasing of Jason Vs Vin was so exciting . Furthermore , a walkthrough is designed where Vin vs Jason is interrupted by another party .
The end of the story comes when Diesel get cornered by Jason , suddenly Dwayne came and shot Jason with a machine gun .
The next scene was the demolishing of the whole building as well as blowing up of Jason 's helicopter .
Finally , Diesel was found alive and get evacuated to the medical center , while Jason was taken to the jail .
Vin 's family lived happily ever after because the enemy was eradicated and the rest were got jailed .
Moreover , the special effects which are displayed are so immense and cause us to feel the emotions of the actors .
I know how much you like both activities so just I suppose you are having a hard time .
I still remember the first day we went to attend a soccer lesson . You promised me you would never give up!. You dreamt of becoming a professional player and decided what your life would be like once you achieved it .
As you asked my take , what I tried to do was nothing but think of you as if you were my son .

Then , once we get on the car , I 'd let the music we had planned before as the ideal background absorb us before uttering any words .

Perhaps the next day , he wo n't even be able to recall what the talk was about , but I 'm pretty sure that after all this , deep down himself he will know what the best move to make is ! !
You just need practise .
Driving my own car seems really convenient for travelling , but public transportation is the most effective way to bring people from one place to another .

For example , a bus can take more than 40 passengers one time at a low cost .
Too many vehicles in a crowned city will increase the carbon dioxide emissions .
Too many vehicles in a crowded city would increase the carbon dioxide emissions .
In conclusion , public transportation will still play an important role in transportation in a city , unless environmentally - friendly vehicles are promoted by the government and the roads and highways in a city are managed well to accommodating a huge number of cars .

Personally , people must dedicate most of their time on things they should do for two important reasons .
I started to feel bored with the complementary courses on my curriculum because they were the kind of courses that did n't have any relevance to my university course , which is mainly about System Engineering , and I was required to take complementary courses such as Ecology , Laws , and so on .
That experience taught me how important it is doing whatever you are required to do - such as taking complementary courses - without rejecting it , because somehow it 'll be helpful later in life .
You 'll dedicate your time only on things for personal enjoyment and it will really hurt you .
For instance , a friend of mine called Freddy was in a social club in the city . He was required to do a running around the pool for 30 minutes .
Nobody had noticed that the president of the social club has an award for the runner , and he received an amount of 30,000 dollars for his effort .
To sum up , it is a good decision if you do things that are necessary or needed at the moment , even though you do n't like it .
So , we should focus our minds making the right decision and spend our time wisely doing what is most important .
Some people think that computers are the most important invention over the last century , while others think that there are a lot of inventions throughout history that are more important than the computer .
Some people think that computers are the most important invention of the last century , while others think that there are a lot of inventions over history that are more important than the computer .
Personally , I think the computer brings many changes in the world , and it is for that I think it is the most important invention .
Some people say that the computer change the way people see the world , and this changes the way in which humans perceive everything that happens around the world or only in their social life .

For example , one person can be informed about what is happening to the other side of the world with just a click .
For other part , other people only use the computer to have communication with someone , have entertainment with some movies , which can be from anywhere , or simply have some fun online with their friends that live abroad or are busy all the time .
For example , the paper or the wheel .
Overall , people are divided in what they think about the most important invention in the world and what changes these objects make to the world and humanity . I still think that the computer is the most important invention because it not only changes one part of history like paper or the wheel did , it changes every aspect of a human 's life .

Thank you for your reply , it was so useful , but I still have some questions and I will be really pleased if you could give me this necessary information .
First of all , I want to know what water sports you offer , because our group of students would probably be interested in doing something related to water , for instance , surf , diving or sailing , due to the fact that they are used to being constantly in contact with the sea ( we live in Barcelona ) and , therefore , they develop a real passion for it .

In my opinion , this statement could be made for a person who lives in a city with little traffic or a person who prefers to travel in a free way instead of being concerned about public transport schedules .

However , I do n't think that this affirmation would be correct for a person who lives in a big city , especially if you take into a count the economic aspects .
In my view , using public transport in this case have two important advantages : the first one is you do n't have to worry about parking ; the second one is you can move in a relaxed way , reading a book , listening to music or talking with other passengers .

Nevertheless , having a car in a big city is quite expensive nowadays , not only because the price of petrol is continuously rising , but also you have to pay high taxes for the car .

In short , although travelling by car is more comfortable and easier than doing it by public transport , it is not probable that in the near future they disappear .

You would not think , it but when you are just thinking , you may have the chance to invent something new and useful for humanity .
Inventors work years to achieve their goals . They are working on their project every day , like you .
Using new vehicles , travelling can be more comfortable and easier .Everyone in this world would have a better life . I am really happy when I simply see a new bus with air conditioner or anything which can make travelling enjoyable .
If the bus drivers could follow their time table there would n't be any argument .
If the bus drivers could follow their timetables there wo n't be any argument .
They will only follow orders and would n't be late and there would not be any arguments .
In conclusion , we have a lot of things o improve .
We can also help by paying our tickets . Yes , this is simple , but these companies need money to improve their businesses .
It was raining cats and dogs when she realized that he had lost one of the most important things in her life .
Probably that day was the worst day in her life , besides her hasn't got married , her sister had died in a car accident . It had been a terrible accident . Her sister was driving from Ciudadela and she crashed into a tree .

Hello I 'm Mathieu Sanabria and I 'm here to deny and explain everything about the case of my sextape . I went to a party with my football team - mates and we were having a whale of time . Then some girls arrived and I started to talk with one of them .

Then many days later , I received a call from a guy who told me that he had a very explicit video of me doing things with a girl and that if I did n't give him some money he would put that video on the Internet .

In other ways I 'll talk about Benzema . He is my friend for many years , but I 'm not sure if he is with me or with the others guys , so I want to listen to their version of the story so he is here to talk about that .
I 'm gutted because he is my childhood friend .
He made a video his friend and Mathieu .
He asked me how much money he should wanted from Mathieu ? Then I asked him how much he needed?He said about one hundred thousand euros and after that I said " you can get it " . With hindsight , I was wrong because it was illegal .

Since he took up office in 2002 , Lula has made major structural changes in Brazil , taking out more than forty million Brazilians out of extreme poverty .
During Lula 's era , from 2002 to 2010 , Brazil experienced an economic boom like never before and became a world 's economic power .
Furthermore , I worked in some major companies when I finished my degree in Journalism five years ago .
By the way , I had experience in the organization of sport and evening activities because , at university , I did a course in Public Relations .
If you want to see my reports , I can send you whenever you want or , if you prefer to ask my teachers about me , I can send you their phone numbers in case you want references from my job .

Long distances between cities makes it difficult to use cars .
Airplanes are the best way to travel through long distances .
transport workers by public transportation or by bus is more convenient for big companies .
You do n't have to think about bus timetables and gates .
You only have to go to your car , sit in and drive away .
All that you need is a driving licence , a car and a little bit luck that there is no traffic .
You have to be fast , if you want a seat to sit ; sometimes the trains are full of people and you have to stand the whole way !
You can stop wherever you want and there are a lot of other reasons to travel with car .

A wall of a tennis field can be a good start to learn how to kick a ball .

Learning to do juggling will also be beneficial .
Because all the people have got predicaments .

Next , to the explosion of the North American steamer , Maine , the Spanish commission created to investigate this explosion assures us that it could n't be done from the outside , but must have been done from the inside .
However , the Spanish government does not agree with the USA 's conclusions and they request North Americans to solve this disagreement with international arbitrage .
Mackinley ask for the arbitration of Pope León XII in the conflict and Spain asks North Americans to get off of Cuban beaches in order to show their desire to put an end to the conflict .

Therefore , public transport plays an important role to mitigating global warming .

What is more , celebrities , like ordinary people , need some time to rest and some time to build deep relationship with others .
As ordinary people , they need someone to take care of them , someone to share their feelings with .

Years ago , we used to get through with other people by ringing them up or texting messages via our mobile phone and , as time goes by , nowadays we also can communicate via social networks such as Twitter , Facebook , Whatsapp ... First of all , we use them to catch up on news and social issues via Twitter instead of newspapers , for instance . It 's common to see people having breakfast in a cafeteria readings the news on their smartphone , an image so far from years back .

Moreover , in general , an artifact or social symbol is buried with its owner after he or she died .

At the present time , modern science is providing some evidence of a real beneficial effect of garlic consumption in human health .
Experiments made with garlic and some types of bacteria , revealed the ability of garlic to kill some kinds of bacteria .
Therefore , the bactericidal effect of garlic can probably explain some ancients ' beliefs that this plant can help in some illness treatments .
Therefore , include garlic in the diet can really be beneficial for health , as some cultures believed .

At home , I have separate garbage bins for paper , plastic and organic wastes .
Fourthly , I am only buying organic products for consumption and keep a small spice garden in my backyard .
All in all , I think that helping our environment does n't have to be a big deal . We should be aware of the fact that mother earth is irreplaceable nor irrevocable .
That is a small start , but will eventually reap a huge outcome .

Public transport is not as valued as it should be although a lot of people uses it every day .
Firstly , it is very good for the environment because it reduces a lot of carbon dioxide gas which , if everybody took the car instead of taking public transport , would pollute the atmosphere .
Secondly , travelling on public transport makes it much easier to travel in rush hours or in those moments in which you should not take your car .
To conclude , public transport is good for the environment , it makes it much easier and cheaper to travel , and it , in some way , saves lives .
For those reasons and some others , I think that public transport must be here for many years to come .

Next week a cousin that he did not know . He was a very rich man and when he knew about their problem , he decided to help , so he gave them an incentive .
He said that if Nick built a house with two floors , he would buy it and pay the children 's studies lifelong , which gave a reverse to the impossible .

I have to swim in the Parana river with all the swimmers and coaches .
First , when I was on the starting line , I felt I could not finish the competition . Then , when we were in the water the coaches did not stop encouraging us so it was easy to swim to the finishing line . I was so exciting to see our families waiting for us , clapping and shouting loudly every time one of us arrived .

One of the advantages pointed out by local politicians in the meeting was that this bypass would lower the rate of air pollution around town , which I strongly agree with , because the extra traffic caused by the passing cars added to the vehicles used by the locals causes massive smog in the atmosphere , not to mention being terribly bad for the health of the walking , cycling citizens , especially young children and babies .
Mostly from 7 to 8 am and 3 to 4 pm , when people go and finish work . That is when we get the most awful traffic jams , sometimes it takes an hour to get from A to B in town , which is a terribly long time , not to mention parents who have to take their children to school , nursery and then get to work , too .
All in all , I would say the bypass would be more of a disadvantage than advantage , because it would cut us off from people and the town would receive less funding if it 's less important .
The day before , I started to freak out thinking that I was meeting them .
At 17:00 they let us into the venue and they made all the checks .

In some countries , the amount of transportation such as train is not sufficient , which forces people to use private cars .
If a car which emits no serious global - warming gases were developed , there would be no argument that people had better reduce their use of cars . Yet , as long as we are manufacturing them , we can not find more eco - friendly and efficient ways than public transportation .

In conclusion , it is my belief that it is not possible for public transport to disappear in the future , even though travelling by cars is more convenient than travelling by just trains or buses .
But as with cars development , our governments might have to make some progress on public transport to encourage citizens to be more eco - friendly .

Having a car takes a lot of money .
Using public transport is cheaper than having a car , especially living in urban area .

All my life I practiced sports , but definitely , my favorite sport is squash .

The poor two had gone too far and now they had to go back .
There are several reasons to believe that . Firstly , many people are influenced by the advertising , which mixes happiness with driving cars and makes people think that public transport is not as a smart option as cars .
In second place , it is not enjoyable to wait for the bus or the underground .
For example , you should take public transport instead a car because it produces less pollution .
In addition , public transport is cheap because buying a car means spend a fortune and in big cities where people are concerned about the environment , such as Amsterdam or Tokyo , there are many facilities like mobile phone apps or special offers .
To sum up , no one knows the future . However , I believe that travelling on public transport is as convenient as by car or more so , because it is good to save up money and to reduce pollution .
In the first place , you feel more comfortable in your own car than on a bus , for example . You do n't need be afraid that someone could suddenly steal your purse and you do n't have to listen to others when you travel in your car .

I graduated in 2010 , majoring in accounting , with a degree having an accumulated GPA of 2.49 out of 5 . Since I came here , I have been so ambitious that I will be getting my high studies as soon as I finish studying English .

As in Rust and Bone , in the movie of Silver Linings Playbook , Pat companies with Tiffany to break away from the past ; and Tiffany help Pat to get the courage to find the way back into love .
Ali realizes he loves Stephanie and he wo n't be the man he used to be anymore , who do n't believe in love and only wanted one - night stands .

This two movies give us a concept : no matter how bad their lives are , love can make people brave and help them find the value of their lives again .

These two movies give us a concept : no matter how worse their lives are , love can make people brave and help them find the value of their lives again .
On the other hand , the characters in Rust and Bone are suffering from declined life quality ; Stephanie lost her legs , and Ali is an poor man .
Although their hearts are all empty , the harsh environment is more hard to survive .
In my opinion , being included in the latest TV news is a huge contribution , great opportunity to introduce yourself in the way you like .
It is possible to find many examples which confirms that argument .
On the one hand , I think that the most significant is societal problems because they cause other problems , including environmental one .
Whereas developed countries became aware of these problems , poor countries have plenty of societal problems , so they continue to affect the environment in a negative way .
On the other hand , sometimes environmental problems can be a reason for societal one .
It happens when some natural disasters happen .

It have an undesired impact on society as people are forced to save their lives , leave or renovate their houses , and to look for clothes , food and other things .

We believe that we can develop leadership in each person and these ways we can avoid a lot of global problems .
I hope this international experience will teach me how to work on increasing my country welfare .
Though new problems occur quickly in our state , some people and community try to do their best to develop a civil and democratic society .
We need external help to find out how to cope with both societal and environment problems .
Moreover , our country pays little attention to them , so population has to do everything on their own .
In conclusion , each problem must be solved concerning societal and environmental issues that impede a further progress of our civilization .
What is more , this project will give me valuable experience , including specific skills that I can use to spread healthy tendencies in the social sphere and careful attitudes to the environment .

It 's a multimedia device that while you watch TV , you can listen and see other people or cartoons , and it seems the characters are alive talking directly to you .
Today the networks have a schedule of 24 hours of activities , you can watch the programs at any time you want to , and if you do n't like a program , you can change the channel and watch something else . Through the increase of channels and competitiveness , the audience has also increased its power of choice .
The programs tend to reproduce our real life and our desires , such as a soap opera which presents characters with difficulties in their lives , but there are also the solution to all the problems at the end ; the lady gets married and lives happily with her love forever .

Although they have a nice ending , we need to remember that real life is different and the difficult are part of our lives . They are there for us to give value to everything we have and to remind us how fragile and , at the same time , how powerful we are .

We can also watch a documentary that teach us a lot !
There are documentaries produced with so many care that they provide us with a lot of information . Sometimes it 's much better than reading a book or having a class .

In the last 10 years , every second family has had more than one car and , most of the time , each member of the family drives his own car .
Recently , governments in many countries imposed a ban on parking or even a ban for driving in major city centres , because this leads to increasing traffic jams .
Only public transport is permitted on the main streets , because it is used from a lot of people .
They do not like travelling by bus or trams .

In my opinion , these measures related to the ban on cars in the city centres are effective and limit the traffic jam and the air pollution .
Each character in this play who is able to do magic uses it in a different way . For example : to help ; for their own need .
A good use of magic is when Oberon use ' love in idleness ' to make or rather " force " Demetrius to fall in love with Helena .
He uses it to help her and try to solve the problems in the lovers relationship , as Lysander and Demetrius are in love with Hermia . Consequently , Helena is in love with Demetrius .
However , just as magic caused this chaos , it also resolved in it .
The image of the elegant fairy queen referring to a man with a donkey head as her ' lover'(3:2:186 ) seems ridiculous .

Titania 's uses her magic to ' bless'(5:1:383 ) the bride 's bed so that Theseus and Hippolyta will have beautiful children and live a happy married life .
Their magic , like Oberon , is used to help people , and not for themselves .
Also , the fairies language is magical , as most of their lines are spells and sound as if they were in a fairy tale .
Even the sound of these two words sound like fantasy .
He uses indirect word , e.g. He does n't just say love potion .
She describes the winter as ' angry'(2:1:112 ) as Winter is sometimes thought of a miserable season .
Also , there is the idea of the alteration of form that Bottom 's head gets ' translated'(3:1:104 ) expresses the magical feeling that again this is not possible in the human world .
I personally think , without magic , this book will not be as popular or engaging .

Another way to encourage students to find the perfect job would be courses and qualification .
Universities are supposed to give their students information about the skills that a job involves .But sometimes , universities give them more theoretical training instead of the practical training which enterprises are looking for .

Nowadays , we have " n " number of international sports where one can prove one 's own talent and socialism .
My favourite sport is Badminton because we can have lots of fun while playing .
The mode of playing can be singles or double 's .

To be a successful player , one has to learn some tricks which helps make the game easier .
And last but not least , as a player , they has to keep in mind that they should not get depressed when they feel that their game is going out of their hands . Instead of that , one has to fight until the last minute of the game in order to decide whether the player is the winner or the loser .

I 'm suggesting you choose between two different places : the beach or mountain .
However , if you do n't like sand at all , you can choose the other option in the mountain .

More and more people start wondering about their health , something that makes them not use their cars as often as they used to .

However , that does n't mean public transport have to disappear .
Everyone ca n't afford a car or , for some reason , some people are n't able to drive one .
Therefore , it is very important to continue a public transport now and in the future .
In conclusion , from my point of view , people from all over the world would rather travel by car than travel by public transport , but we 'd better use this means of transport if we want to continue living in accurate conditions .
During a meeting with the head of department in MOH , I was complaining about servicing of the microscope by their staff ( almost 99.9% from Olympus Microscopes are not under Service Contract , and handling by Electronic W / S in M.O.H. ) and I suggested to providing the required training for all his staff , in order to improve the quality of Olympus Microscopes service .

Firstly , I asked about the music that is listened to and about their favourites styles and groups and the results showed us that they are n't similar compared to the music they liked a few years ago .
In fact , they can hardly ever defined themselves as pop fans , rockers , ...
In addition , plenty of girls who were interviewed told they could n't stand reggaeton music , but they usually want to listen to it at discos because they can dance .

There have been good progress in transport in both respects .
Transport has become faster and more convenient , and it can be attributed to a lot of factors , such as better roads , new technologies and innovations etc .
Transport has become faster and more convenient , and this can be attributed to lot of factors , such as better roads , new technologies and innovations etc .
Also , as public transport such as the metro do not need to deal with traffic , it is always a faster way to get to the office .
On the other hand , if I would be travelling to see my friends or family in a nearby town or just on a holiday tour , I would prefer my car .
In future , environment will also become a key factor in determining the state of these modes of transport .
I think education is one of the most important thing for everyone .
In my opinion , it is probably the base of the values of every society , because our children now will be the men or women of the future .
I studied in a state school and I believe that I get a good education , not only academic training but also strong principles to live in society .
From my point of view , I feel like we are losing important things like the effort to achieve goals or respect everyone .
From my point of view , I feel like we are losing important things like the effort to achieve goals or respectful for everyone .
For instance , knowing other languages , like English , is increasingly day by day .
To sum up , education is , in my opinion , the most important base of any society and it should be accessible to all people .

This report is intended to evaluate the Active Leisure Club and to give some suggestions to the Club 's new facilities .
Although facilities are well organised , they are too small , because more and more people are becoming members of the club .
To who may concern ,
My name is Gerard Jones and rather than telling you that I always wanted to work with children ,
My expertise is to organise games for children . Everybody enjoys the way I develop my strategy and they just ca n't resist the team 's rivalry during the games .
My expertise is to organise games for children . Everybody enjoy the way I develop my strategy and they just ca n't resist the team rivalry during the games .
I am also a talented cooker for kids . My view is also trying to convince them that cooking is fun and sometimes they ask me to teach them how to make basic dishes , such as omelettes , spaghetti and more .
Doing sports is a good way to forget about real life . You focus on the competition and it is like to have a rest from everyday life .
I 'm so glad to hear that you are giving me an opportunity to make your club facilities improvement .
I would like to recommend that the gym opens at 7:00 AM for people who want to visit there a little bit earlier and the changing room heating should be fixed .

The problem with this mansion is that it hides a lot of secrets and mysteries which are going to be discovered by its temporary owners , who are a family whose husband went to war and died . So the real occupants of the house are Nicholas , an easily scared boy , his sister Anne , who turns to be one of the most important characters in the film , and their mother , who is called Grace and has a particular obsession with catholisism .
The other characters that also take an important part in the movie are the servants .
The film describes how the love that a mother can give to her children can easily turn into an obsession . However , what makes this film so special is that that pretends to be a typical horror movie , but in its final scene , there is a sudden change which makes it more interesting .

I would recommend this film to anyone , even those who are easily scared , because it is not like the rest of the horror movies . It is a film in which you are continuously discovering secrets as if you where another character .
Public transport is the mode of transport for passenger who can travel from one place to another for less money .
Everyone felt so delighted , but unfortunately , now people feel uncomfortable when it comes to travelling via public transport .
Everyone felt so delighted , but unfortunately , now people feel uncomfortable when it comes to travel by public transport .
In the early days of public transport , people only stick to their normal routine and did not wish to earn more from their job or work .
Today , every single person is keen to earn as much money as they can and the interesting part is that this curiosity is increasing day by day , and so is their income .
Today , every single person is curious to earn as much money as they can and the interesting part is that this eagerness is increasing day by day , and so is their income .
So , now , almost 80 percent people can afford their own transport .
Public transport is slow now , even though it is very comfortable , but unfortunately , people feel public transport is for poor people and if any middle class or upper class were to travel through public transport , it would affect their status .

If they would be financially stable , they would surely buy their own vehicle .
So it is a question that required deeper reflection from all of us .
What is more , when we speak about pollution we are not only talking about exhumes fumes .
I am very happy with the idea to encouraging public transport 's use because it makes cities a better place to live .
I am very happy with the idea of encourage public transport 's use because it makes cities a better place to live .
If everyone travelled by bus , cities would be quite different the ones we know now .
I really liked to work with special effects and the best thing was that I learnt a lot about that technology .
In addition to this , we do n't have to spend too much time looking for a bus which would go specifically to our destination .
We should encourage public transportation all we can because every city now has a huge number of cars on its streets and this number is going up rapidly . Having this huge increasing in cars will impact badly on public health & the environment and infrastructure .
It is more convenient with modern lifestyle to travel in a car because of the privacy and independence.the remarkable development of car 's luxury features and other options .

However , it will be over cost in full , car service and the effort of concentration on driving . All of these negativity can easily be avoided by using public transportation . It should be cheaper than using your own car , you do not have to look after it , and you can do activities while you are on it , like reading or chatting with your friends or making important phone calls .

The environmental impact is an important factor we should consider . Having this number of cars is like having thousands of factories on our streets giving out tons of CO2 gas and many other polluting gases . The speed of new trains or planes or even buses is now competing with car 's speeds and is even faster than cars in a lot of places .

Using public transportation is better than using individual cars , but we should put more attractive things inside and should have new designs and more privacy and luxury means . Extending the use of electric cars and other clean energy is very important right now to reduce environmental pollution as much as we can .

The population grows , with more business skyscrapers , residential houses and advanced transportation , at the cost of diminishing farmland wetland as well as deforestation .
The red coral reef off the coast of Australia , for instance , serve as a shelter for algae and other tiny sea fishes and an index of environmental fragility .
Due to the massive construction of five - star hotels on beaches , the biological chain there are cut off and environmental variations are gone away .
On top of that , it is the regulation capacities of the environment for temperature , moisture and even sandstorms are erode as less plants inhale carbon dioxide and exhale oxygen into the whole system .
On top of that , it is the regulation capacities of the environment for temperature , moisture and even sandstorms are eroding as less plants inhale carbon dioxide and exhale oxygen the whole system .
Because the population density is increasing all the time currently , the loss triggered by these disasters are damaging and unaffordable for any single family .
In a bid to address these side effects that civilization bring about , governments must take measures step by step to tackle them .
Secondly , the government must fund environmental organizations , in order to manipulate and coordinate more power to stop illegal hunting , deforestation and animal extinctions .
Furthermore , the government should go out of their ways stand united in such a way that joint endeavours can be effective globally .

Public transport include buses , trains , and subway , but cars , bicycles , taxis are not forgotten .

Many people think that the first impression we give and our appearance are very important in our life ; but , should it be like this ?
We have subjective opinions ; we normally judge because we have a preconception idea .
Most people would agree that fashion is something that takes part in our day - to - day lives .
And the same happened with parties , festivals , sports and other events .
Overall , my personal opinion is that we give too much importance to clothes and appearance than it should .
Although on some occasions some clothes styles are required , people should have the freedom to choose what clothes they want to wear , and it should not have consequences in our life .

The first solution is change the portion size of soft drinks , which means smaller size of beverages could contain less sugar .
The limitation of this solution is the public may not be satisfied with this size of soft drinks .
This would help the teenagers who drink soft beverage decrease sugar intake efficiently .

They would not consume such a large number of beverages .
In conclusion , increasing consumption of soft drinks is one of the issues to prevent from obesity .
Therefore , parents education and changing portion size could be useful to address the problems which arise around teenagers .
If we take these measures soon and keep them up for a long time , obesity would not happen in the next generations .
We can say that Coyle 's idea is well developed thanks to two features that run through the chapter and likely the entire book : first of all , many significant references and specialized people are mentioned to define what " deep practice " is ( a psychologist , some experts in their own field , authors who have already analyzed that particular topic … ) ; secondly , but no less important , Coyle himself collected most of his information while visiting at least nine places , nine " hotbeds " ( 12 ) where talents grow , as a sort of collection of data gathered from laboratory experiments .

In my day friendships were easily made with neighbours , schoolmates and social clubs friends .
I already experienced one friendship through an organization , International Youth Service IYS , a charitable association established for youth friendship .
In which we have to wait more than thirty days to send and receive one message that can be exchanged these days with one button press .
I have personal experience that dates back to 1987 . In that year , I had started a pen friendship with a German girl called Claudia who was 17 years old then .
It is not necessary to agree with each other in everything where we always debate and challenge whose opinion is correct .
Real friendships that are ever - lasting like what I am actually made with my two best friends , should be founded on trust and faith .

In addition , sometimes you have to combine both of these in order to arrive on time to your workplace .
For instance , if you have to go another city by bus or train to reach your workplace , the time you waste since you set off increases .
Moreover , the use of your own car has more advantages . Travelling by car avoids you getting wet when the weather is rainy .
However , there is some people who prefer the use of public transport instead of using the car .
Although it has some benefits , in most part of the country , especially in the smallest towns , the public transport is not developed enough .
To sum up , I believe that public transport has no future because it makes you to waste a lot of time , it is not developed enough in small areas and trains and buses are not frequent enough .
.H. Lawrence 's saying " Nobody ought to own houses or furniture - any more than they own the stones of the high road " is an ambiguous saying that questions the need of the people regarding a high number of properties .
Secondly , as I said , " to a certain degree " , the idea of controlling one 's own choices regarding house choice and what they can do with their houses takes away a bit of their freedom , which is the complete opposite of what we should do .
Mankind has always strived for freedom in one way or another , and taking away control over their own house , their sanctuary , will not be taken lightly by them .
In conclusion , I can not say whether or not control of people 's houses and furniture will bring any help in today 's society , as we are only speaking hypothetically , without any form of testing . However , it does have its strong and weak points .

Now we are spending too much time waiting for public transport and , of course , we would like to get our destination as fast as possible , but public transport does n't provide such a possibility for us .

For instance , one day I was walking in the park when I saw a girl falling down from a children swing in the playing area . I helped her immediately , and after I was sure that she was fine , I called her mother and told her about this incident . She thanked me a lot .
I was thinking she was my responsibility , but it ca n't be the same every time .

It sounds a little bit strange , but by installing solar panels and other features in these homes , we live a much greener life . Undoubtedly , there would be some changes but , because we know why we are doing it , there would be no problems .
Also , the effects of those actions would be huge and would help improve the environment situation . Nevertheless , we will still have to change some activities and be less self - centred , so that we can all work for a greater objective .
I play football twice a week as minimum .
If you want to start to play football , my advice is to be fit , because if you are n't , you can hurt your bones or muscles .

Consequently , Vietnamese children do n't have any life skills and have many health problems , such as short - sighted , tummy - ache , spinal column … Sadly , the proportion of Vietnamese children who are short - sighted has tended to increase in recent years .
Meanwhile , Australian parents also care about their children but a different way to Vietnamese parents .
Outside school , they send their kids to sports Centre or social activities .

My first time was an exciting experience I will never forget : the touch of the rock , the height , the pain in your fingers ... I like climbing because this sport makes me feel alive , even sometimes I feel fear .

Each of the cities has a unique set of transportation means .
In regional centers , most people commute on trolleybuses and tramcars .
The latter is the transport of choice of most people because its passengers very rarely lose time in traffic jams thanks to dedicated railway lines .
Those who are not satisfied with public transportation system may use private vehicles .
I expect them to be much more suitable for bikes compared to local roads .
Thanks to my mom , to my travels and to the people I 've met , I 've learnt how to speak fearless and quite fluently in English .
I 've had a little bit of experience of summer babysitting some kids . In Italy it is more difficult to be a babysitter because , if you are underage , parents should take responsibility for you , so it is better to be over 18 .
During those few times through which I built my experience , we all played together and we cooked together , so I taught them how to make some chicken and some pasta in the Italian way .
One of my characteristics is that I 'm a very precise person . For example , I enjoy making lists because they make my mind clearer , and I strictly follow what I wrote so everything , hopefully , endes well .

However , in my opinion , it will rather useful to use public vehicles as time goes by for two critical reasons .
Using public transport means help to protect the Earth from air pollution .
There are so many kinds of problems which the environmental pollution causes .
I am a very active person and I am accustomed to doing different kind of sports activities , such as swimming and riding .
I consider me a responsible person with the ability to face any kinds of problems .
As for languages , I speak native Spanish and Catalan and also I speak French and German fluently and recently I have passed the First certificate in English .

For example , I designed the high - rise architecture in a highly population density city in Taiwan .

For instance , when we enjoy the electronic commerce and shop goods on the Internet , the hacker may steal private information at the same time .
They will use that information to steal people 's money over the phone and you will trust them because they have the correct personal information .
This is a normal phenomenon in Taiwan . However , police ca n't do anything because of the hacker 's anonymity .

As soon as I read the letter about your problem , I decided to write you at once and give you some suggestions , since I have the similar interest in physical fitness , too .
I feel very strongly that daily exercise is a basic definition which we must keep if we want to be on shape .
For example , you could go on foot or on your bicycle accompanied by your friends instead . By doing this , you will burn more and more calories daily without a special equipment and having fun with your pals .
What is more , it could help if you work out at home and bought gym equipment such as a treadmill or a bicycle .

Plenty of ways can be used to make new friends .
In my opinion , the best way to develop your new friendship is meeting them ; have a coffee , a drink or whatever .
To be frank , a best friend has to offer you a different point of view and , what is more , it is important say no sometimes .
For all of these reasons , we have to take care of our friendships these days and social networks are OK to being in touch with your friends . But if you want to make new ones .

Monday , I had the typical " family day " . I had been eating with all my family in our cottage .
I was all the day lying on the beach , talking with my friends and having an incredible time with them .
I was at home all day with my cat watching English film and eating Spanish dessert .
I almost eat it all !
Those two day were family days . I had to go to the church to a mess which represent the last days alive of Jesus Christ : the last supper and the passion .

Imagine to go by car to cities like London . Is the car more convenient ?
On the other hand , it is possible to find hybrid cars , but they are more expensive than those that works with normal fuel and , for that reason , this kind of car is not people 's first choice .
A country has to pay for their carbon footprint and this means the more pollution is produced , the more the environment damage . In other words a , bigger carbon footprint means more has to be paid .
Governments will define environmental policies in order to decrease the costs of carbon footprints .
Such policies will involve taxes on polluting cars , the increasing of fuel price and the introduction of benefits for those who opt for more environmental means of transport .

Although there are a lot of reasons that support that idea , this article focuses about the importance of reading as a great tool to exercise our brain .

Secondly , there are some research that proves that , in general , people who read are smarter than people who do not .

How was your first English literature lesson at school ? I hope it was loads of fun with plenty new knowledge acquired !
I learnt the special features of the 16th century acting business and theatres in London , as well as the life of William Shakespeare .
You may think theatres would be fashionable place for royalty , courtiers and merchants .
However , it were not .
As it cost very little to get into an open - aired theatre , everyone jammed in and jostled to watch plays , though the poor stood under bright sunshine and had their heads burnt , while the rich sat under shelter with an extra shilling paid .

At that time , males had to work while women were forced to stay at home and do all the household chores .
What a gargantuan sacrifice of self - esteem and reputation they had made !
It could reflect the fact that 16th century London was a melting point of different cultures and Shakespeare probably got in touch with Italian culture by making friends with those local visitors .

As you asked I am going to give information of how my village looks after the environment .
My village has been working on this project for decades . They have been fixing their techniques and they still know a day 's everything has cost us a lot of effort , we started from the easiest examples ( dividing rubbish into different containers ) to some that are more complex ( renewable energy ) .
We live in an area where the population has all types of animals which can get hurt very easily by human 's activities ; so in our community we have very strict rules when it comes to taking care of the environment .
The principal things everyone must have at their houses are three trash can for the division of the trash ; one must be for renewable materials ( leftovers , paper , cardboard … ) another for plastics , and the last one for glass .
All the energy being used in the town is renewable energy ; ( hydraulic energy , solar energy and wind energy ) . Every house has a solar panel that gets the sun light transforming it into energy that provides part of the energy to each house the days that the sun shines , but if there is no sun , the village has a dam beside it which provides us with enough water for the whole village and also with hydraulic energy ; not only do we have hydraulic energy , but also wind energy ; on the outskirts of the village , there is a wind power plant where the wind energy is produced .

It is hard to believe during the time of segregation , black people were treated as second - class citizen not only in real life but also in the constitution .

If there is anything that favors this restaurant , it has to be the quantity they serve ; a surely sufficient quantity along the truly special quality leaves this restaurant as one of the best in town , if not in the whole country .
What about the amazing eccentric atmosphere they have to offer ? With a soulful live band and an elegant dining set , their atmosphere adds up to the flavor of their food .
In addition to that , they will be able to offer a connected table that could fit ht whole class , professionally named the meeting table .
This restaurant has to be the right choice for two reasons . Firstly , it offers a traditional menu which will ensure to cover all different tastes .
At the end of my essay , I would like to devote this paragraph to thank my wonderful teacher for this opportunity to offer my sincere opinion on the topic .

Nobody would argue the significance and effectiveness of modern technology , having revolutionised all spheres of human lives by providing a great number of remarkable advantages , such as mass production , information and communication devices , as well as medical and scientific breakthroughs .

Rules of engagement are quite simple .
The first and most important rule is you do not let the opponent player who raids your field ( the box ) touch your border ( Border Line ) . The second rule is you do not let the opponent cross over the ' No man 's land ' ( The centre line ) , when the opponent touches the Border of your's .

The opponent must raise a leg when the other one touches the border to tell them " Lo , I am in your territory " . If the opponent touches the border , he can retreat to his field , no shame in that , but he do n't get any points .

Each team gets an opportunity to raid the other 's field alternatively , and the first one to raid is decided by the toss of a coin , as is usual in most games .
A number is decided to count the dead ones and whichever team reaches that number first loses the game to the another .
The rules are pretty simple , but the game is quite tough , you could hurt yourself really bad .
One can wonder , but we can find the reason in their Sangam Literature , written circa 300 BCE .
It says the bravery of a man is reckoned by the number of scars on his body , except on his back , because they thought to be dead on the field is far better than retreating .
It says the bravery of men is reckoned by the number of scars on his body , except on his back , because they thought to be dead on the field was far better than retreating .

So , I like this game because it reflects the Tamil culture 's important value , which is giving high rank to bravery .

subject : the transports in my local area
As requested , I have investigated the features of the main means of transports which are used in my local area .
These are very cheap and people who do not have a car use it to go everywhere . However , this mode of transport is not so comfortable , because sometimes you have to travel with lots of people .
People use their car for travelling a long or short distance . This is really comfortable because you can manage the speed and where you will direct .

There is no need for expensive technical clothes , or special fields , just you and a safe place and with enough space .
You do not need to get any special training when you start to run , you have known how to do it since you are a child .
Nevertheless , once you started to go running , and want to really get into it , and improve , I do recommend you to take care of your health and to find professional assistance .
Injuries may happen as a result of doing it often if you do not know the way you run , or you do not take the necessary time to get the resistant that your body needs , for example .

In my opinion , public transport has been improved over the last years , because cities have been putting a lot of investment into that .
In big cities , such New York , the main public transport is the underground , which is usually fast and not too expensive .
There are other types of public transport such buses , trains , or even planes for long trips .

Nowadays , travel on public transport is an experience who none has failed .
However , there is now a discussion about what the people prefer , public transport or their own vehicle .
There are a lot of benefits to public transport . First , you do n't have to drive yourself , you can listen to music , read a book or whatever you want without having to pay attention to the traffic . It is true , too , that travelling on this way of transport helps the government because you have to pay for it , and the majority of modes of transport are cheap enough for everyone .

However , so many people love having their own vehicle , a car , a bike , a motto , because this give you other kind of freedom , you chose the way , you chose the time , you chose the way in you drive it , the positive thing about this kind of vehicle is that you do n't have to take a bus , for example , crowded with people , you can go alone in your car , or whoever you want , but the important thing is that you choose .

When you use a car , you do not have to think about timetables and you do n't have to pay expensive tickets for travelling .
Related to the use of the car , I would like to say that Extremadura 's roads need a big repair programme because , for example , the road between Cáceres and Badajoz is very damaged and it is difficult to drive for it .
Last year , the mayor changed the old buses by new buses without increasing the prices .
Now , it is safer to travel than previous years .
Also , the seats of this transport are cleaner and the bus driver go saying the name of each stop .

I ca n't stop studying English language . I 'm a sort of ' English addict ' , but I wish I were an English native speaker , I do n't know why .
I 've been studying English at school .
I found myself teaching English in my country , far from the language competence I was longing for .
And finally , the third and last reasons why I think you learn more on placement than at school .
When you go to school you have to follow lessons which are , of course , useful for your knowledge , but , the way of following these lessons are not a natural work pattern .
In a natural work pattern , you have to do , also like school , your tasks , but the communication is also an important part of it .
This important way of communicating is lacking at school , because it 's a nearly a one - directional way of communicating from the teachers .

Therefore , buses do not running as frequently or regularly as they used to .
Secondly , they can visit each place without any circumstances .
For instance , there is no need to change bus .
In addition , the car is also more convenient in respect of timing .
After having had a long day at work , people long to get home as quick as possible .
Finally , it still provides a useful way of travel for all who do n't have a driving licence .
In the end , the service of public transport needs to change to attract more people and to have a brighter future .

It 's a kind of a social network , but it differs a bit from ordinary networks .
On this network you create a profile of your car , write a list of improvements you have made in it , upload photos and movies about your car and , of course , you meet a lot of people with the same interests .
I think it is better than other search engines because it is very fast and you get only the information you asked for and nothing excess .
If you want to spend your time visiting a famous and very beautiful place and see for yourself the main sights in Moscow , I recommend you to visit Red Square .
You will be very exciting seeing St. Basil 's Cathedral , the monument of Minin and Pozharsky , and the Kremlin .

Thus , our state makes no effort to fight it . Transportation now is very overcrowded and difficult , especially in the rush hour when people leave their jobs and go to their houses at 2 o'clock . The main reason for that is the increasing number of people in our country ( housing problems ) and the result of that is a lot of accidents have happened and a lot of people have died .

On the other hand , the pessimistic view , in developed countries like Japan and Kuwait we do n't find problems like these because they have good planning , they make routes underground and overground , then they have routes only for people and ways only for cars .

It 's very hard to organise a big city 's rubbish delivery system and to keep the city clean .
It would be logical that we recycle the garbage as much as possible , and there are factories where they use this technique , but in Budapest we do n't usually use many recycled goods recently .
And it is a serious problem , because in the not too distant future , we wo n't be able to handle the garbage - there wo n't be enough space where we can deposit it .

Although there are a lot of people who strongly believe the best way of travelling around the city is by motorbike , there is also a large part of society who are sure it has too many drawbacks to be worth buying one .
One very important positive aspect is that , thanks to the small amount of petrol it needs , the keeping of a motorbike is considerably economical .

But excluding cases like mine : flying is the fastest , the most safe and often the cheapest way to travel .
In that case , it means that my favourite way to travel is by train !

After he understood the reason why I did n't have any desire to play , he told me to give myself a try , and if I still did n't like it , he would't force me .

The fact that these tools are familiar for youth makes them helpful and useful .
Another transformation , which is related to the advances that humanity have been seeing lately , is the changes in the cities and our living habits .
The urbanization implemented by government across the decades in the cities is sometimes not suitable for all members of the public .
For instance , older people or people with disabilities have great difficult using the metro system because of the number of stairs .

To conclude , the world has a complicated problem , so governments and the charitable organizations must take a quick decision and put in place a real solution to solve this problem .
The Homeless people are human beings and they must take their rights in life .

I have 6 youngest siblings ; 4 girls and 2 boys , and every time my parents go out for a job interview , dinner , to the movies , etc . ,
I always stay home and take care of them . I invent games for them to have fun and they also can learn with them . Sometimes I take them to the sports club I work on . I 'm a swimming teacher and in my free time in the afternoon , I 'm with them in the pool having fun , playing and teaching them to swim .

It seems that the most popular sport in the whole world is football because it keep all people united , so that is why I love this sport and not only because of that , but it makes me feel very excited and it involves a lot of emotion as well . Do you enjoy watching or playing football ?
Surprisingly , when you are playing this sport you improve your speed and coordination too , so it could be an interesting reason for taking it up if you are not involved in it .
Curiously , there are many ways of taking care of yourself when you are taking up this sport , so what I advise you to do is to do some exercise before you go on the pitch , because it not only prevents you from suffer from sprains or other kinds of injuries , but keeps you active to keep the level of your game .

First of all , as dioxides and carbons gases have been increasing ozone pollution in big cities worldwide , awareness campaigns should be promoted to highlight the alternative use of transportation .
Moreover , life may not be possible for the future generations , unless we start from now using renewable sources of energy , like green , to promote sustainability and improve energy efficiency , avoiding side effects for the planet .
To conclude , I firmly believe that we can reduce damage and global warming by adopting environmentally friendly attitudes , as the use of green and clean energy sources .

I was very inspired by your idea and decided to organize an even with charity club members in my school as well .
We decided to organize a play and donate the money we earn to a Dog Foundation .
We tried to involve many students as possible , since we needed actors , costume designers and technicians .
Hope you liked my idea and look forward to hear from you soon .
Just next to the desk , I would put on a small wardrobe ; given that there would have additional drawers under the bed to keep some clothes , a large wardrobe might not be needed .
I might put on a mirror on the inside of one of the wardrobe doors .
Well , I have already explained in detail how I would decorate two of the sides of the room , so now I am going to tell you what there would be in the two remaining walls .
First and foremost , though , I have to say that I am an eager reader . That being said , it may be obvious why I value space so much : I need a place to put my books in .
As far as television is concerned , well , being honest , I haven't watched much TV for years .
So , at most , I would put on a fourteen inch one on the top of one of the bookcases .
So , at most , I would put a fourteen inches one on the top of one of the bookcases .
Secondly , my idea is putting on , at least initially , two lamps : a white overhead one and a red desk one .
Lastly , I could consider also putting on a standard lamp near my reading armchair , but I would need to actually set up and use my dream bedroom to see if it is really worth it .
Finally , concerning the bedroom colours , I believe the walls should be painted in a light colour , like white , beige or , maybe a light green . The ceiling could be the same colour as the walls or , perhaps , a darker hue than they .
I sincerely doubt that I would paint the furniture , though , so they would display the colour of the wood they would be made from .
Lastly , I would like my curtains were red , given that that is my favourite colour ; however , I would use maroon , which is quite similar , for the curtains , because it is more sober and , consequently , more suitable for my room .
I think a family matters a lot to everybody .
We do n't choose parents and children , but we can choose a good husband or a wife .
My parents divorced when I was 16 years old , so I do n't have a close relations with my mom and dad .
My husband is also my best friend , as I do n't have anybody closer than he .
I 'm happy , as I have always dreamt of such a family .
For instance , a network of taxi cabs with affordable prices could combine comfort of a personal car and the work - load of public transportation .
Nowadays , all the car manufacturers have accepted the task of designing a robot - driven car that in future would resolve the issues of safety and availability of taxi 24 hours 7 days a week .
Unfortunately , the main method is to make private cars , if not a luxury , then to make their usage economically less efficient in favour to public transportation .
And the underground , and light tram system are still more ecological and fast .
The aim of this report is to describe the training course that I attended last month , for a week , and the activities in which I was involved during this period of time .
It turned up to be a disadvantage for me , given that I am interested in the theory .
I realised there is no time to think too much when it comes to practice , because you have to act quickly and to prove to yourself and the others that you use your knowledge in order to accomplish a certain task .

We do n't have to drive ourselves , and we do n't have to think which way we should go to reach the destination .
Additionally , taking public transport cost less .
Compared to driving a car , it only cost us about 20 N.T. dollars or at most 50 dollars for one single journey .
Taking public transport can efficiently reduce the emission of carbon dioxides and will help the earth to recover from those disorders .
So , as a member living in our mother earth , we should do our best to protect her .
The above reasons I mentioned explain why I do not agree with the statement that public transport ha no future because travelling by car is more convenient .
What transportation do we need and should be invented now is hard to imagine , because there is no place we ca n't go .
I think transport nowadays are perfect .
Although public transport is enough for people neds , its operation could be improved .
For example , the speed of transportation could become faster , use green energy sources , improved the capacity of the public vehicles and so on .

On the other hand , needless to say , the limitation of a museum is that it can only store some pictures and paintings . It is far from an enjoyable visit when you can only see the picture 2 meters away and not touch .
The scenery , the beauty of mountain and river , can only be enjoyed when you travel there on youe own .

Charles Dickens and Emily Bronte are both Victorian writers .
Their novels have a lot in common : first of all , the plot is usually pretty complex ( as we can see in David Copperfield by Dickens and Wuthering Heights by E. Bronte ) , and so are the characters , which are always well described , especially on a psychological level . Furthermore , both the authors included in their works the figure of the noble who helps the hopeless child who comes from a lower class .
There is also a lot in contrast . Most evident is the difference between the settings : Dickens prefers industrial cities , while Bronte prefers rural villages , and these choices reflect different topics , . In fact , Dickens mostly deals with themes like exploited childhood , the miserable conditions of the lower classes and the bad consequences of industrialisation , In contrast , Emily Bronte is more concerned about the theme of respectability , even if her female heroins do not reflect Victorian values such as chastity and prudery .
Then we can notice that the narrators of the novels have different roles : Dickens 's narrator is omniscient ; Bronte 's one is part of the story itself and can change , revealing characters ' perspectives .

I am currently an intern on a scientific research program in a group called GALP - Logical Programming Teaching Group , that , with the local city hall of Araraquara , aims to transform the city into a national technology , research and software producing center , accomplishing this goal by teaching logical thinking and algorithms to kids , diminishing future evasion in many exact sciences courses .
Although I write and speak English in an advanced proficiency level , this exchange would provide the fluency I need in academic contexts and interpersonal communication . As all of the most relevant papers , research and journals are written in English , I want to achieve this level to make it easier to write and produce good materials for the scientific community , and to communicate better with all cultures .

The English economy changed from an agriculture one to an industrial one : in England there was an increase in pollution and also terrible hygiene conditions , the landscape changed a lot and also houses , shops and people .

To make it clear , the bosses , who are always busy in their business , usually eat fast food , they go to KFC or Lottie Mart to buy them , they even might order fast food by phone because of fast delivery .
In addition , junk food is very easy to find out .
Therefore , finding a good place to buy and enjoy a meal of fast food is not so difficult and it will not take time for people to go back their work on time .
Junk food contains a lot of unhealthy chemicals and high percentage of fat and cholesterol , which are the biggest factors leading customers to obesity and cancers .
According to scientists , people who usually eat a lot of junk food will have more than 50% risk to becoming obese and even dying soon .
Furthermore , most of junk food just solves hunger in a short time and then it will quickly return to the customers after they have felt full .
As a consequence , they gradually forget how to cook a simple meal and the diversity of healthy food is slightly lost .
Some advantages are that fast food can help to save time and deal with the temporary hunger of white - collar - worker , but it can also harm their health .

Hence , every woman must be able to have abortion as a choice .
Development of emotional and psychological problems such as maternal deprivation can be a result .
Many victims believe that the additional trauma related to carrying their rapist child can be avoided by terminating the pregnancy , and therefore help them put the assault behind them and recover more quickly .
Even if abortion has to be given as a choice in special cases , it is not a solutions to accidental pregnancies .
Otherwise , you may run the risk that people seeing abortion as an easy way to get rid of an unwanted pregnancy .
In order to prevent this , it is important to apply strict guidelines regarding situation where abortion is given as an option .
Undeterred by this , it is still the mother 's decision if she wants to save her own life or carry and care for her rapist child .

In the letter he complaints about the out - of - date system of schools in Italy and he made some suggestions about how this could be overcome by major educational reforms .
First of all , the professor says that the majority of Italian teachers are not well prepared to do their work and , consequently , students do n't achieve the skills they should to succeed in a future work , but I do n't agree with this statement .
First of all , the professor says that the majority of Italian teachers are not well prepared to do their work and , consequently , students do n't achieve the skills they should to success in a future job , but I do n't agree with this statement .
This is what , in my opinion , must be changed in schools to satisfy society needs and overcome the old and inappropriate " out - of - date " system .
On the other hand , I personally think that pupils enjoying working with textbooks more because they can do this activity with classmates and they can help each other .
Also , in my opinion , young people should not use computers for much time , because this could be dangerous for their health , causing sight problems or headaches .

The more computer science influences human 's lives , the more important a status robotics has in the field of engineering .
Only a decade ago , robotics was just limited to scientific research .
2012 ) described an experiment by Showa University which aimed to test how well dental students could deal with emergency situation .
The result indicated that although the patients were merely robots , out of 98 candidates , only 22% students gave the diagnoses correctly .
Furthermore , the I - BLOCKS application could also build structures of robots which are able to react to their surroundings , and build binary expression to calculate in real - time and show both final results and sub - results ( Lund , Marti , & Palma , as cited in Nielsen & Lund , 2008 ) .
Suh et al . ( 2010 ) described an experiment that aimed to test differences of time on operating robots to doing tasks .
Suh et al . ( 2010 ) described an experiment that aimed to test differences of time on operating robots for do tasks .
It was found that there was an apparent difference in average speed and completion time when comparing tasks by students with basic knowledge and the one from another group .
Perhaps being familiar with robotics and good at operating could help out of this shortcoming .
Today , more people , not only in the field of education , but also in different fields , have made use of robotics as tools to deepen their exploration and studying .

It is possible that robotics would be a normal part of individuals ' lives .
For a country , robotics could be a new weapons in the future technological wars .
However , the disadvantages of robotics and some social or ethical problems should be considered carefully when robotics is contributing to human 's lives .
Besides its influences on education , robotics has an effect on medical treatment , nursing and even design to future war as well .
Even though robotics brings more beneficial consequences and advantages than its disadvantages , its shortcomings still should not be neglected and more scientific research should be done to improve the application of robotics .

This activity would not demand huge amounts of money to be done and , with an insignificant investment , would help a large group of people who desperately need it .
Once people know all the benefits this sport has , they will need a space to practice it comfortably .
With this in mind , money would be spent on constructing a running rute where no - one would have to worry about traffic or obstacles in their way .
There are almost no contraindications to practise this sport , so almost everybody in the town has the opportunity to try it at least once .

Working in the community is more adequate compared to sending people to prison when criminals have committed a minor offence .
For example , in Bulgaria , people who lay down and relax on the grass in the park are sent to jail for 6 years , because they are considered to be " doing serious damage to the environment and preventing the park from further development " .
This will help them realize their mistakes and thus , quit doing them .

Having easy access to such a rich offering before having developed the ability to make correct choices or filter the information received , our children and young people are constantly under attack of dangerous role models , being attracted by the ones who seem the most winning and cool ones , without any chance to distinguish if they can be taken as a guide to their growth or not .

The absence of parents or the fact they usually have no control nor way to drive their choices makes me very worried about the future of our society .

In desperation , he stepped to the river bank .

Only in that moment will we understand that we are one of the millions pensioners who need a lot of different services to live as fulfilled and independent a life as we deserve .
First of all , it will be a good idea to encourage young people to start saving money as soon as possible .
The pensioners will receive their money when they retire .
It would be a long - lasting benefit for both parts .
Our state will have a large sum of money , which is an invaluable resource .
On the other hand , the pensioners will be sure of their future .
Everyone should think not just about his benefit , but about others .
Firstly , I have to say that I disagree about the statement " There is no future for public transport " . I think public transport has lots of advantages , more than travelling by car .
You can relax when you are travelling , listening music or reading a book .
So , I think the statement would be like this : " There is no future for travelling by car , because public transport is so much more convenient and cheaper " .

Moreover , they often smoke and drink alcohol , which produces serious physical and mental diseases ( CasaColumbia , 2007 ) .
On the other hand , cars tend to pollute more than electric trains and such problem ought to be taken into consideration when someone has to decide between using public transport or a car .
Although we can choose more destinations and it is more comfortable , prices are not competitive enough to definitely substitute the car .
If not , they would not make the investment of a car and pay its maintenance costs and fuel .

More and more , the oil shortage makes prices for fuel increase , and so does the price for transport ; the economic policy of importing countries tends to establish saving measures in order to be strategically less dependent .
To sum up , future generations will have to face the challenge of a sustainable world and , surely , public transport will play an important role .

Bamboo Charcoal ( $ 138 ) - I got to watch the chef as he prepared my dessert at the counter and I was getting more and more excited to tating his artful presentation as it came to life !
This was a chocolate theme dessert with bamboo charcoal ice cream , chocolate ice marshmallow , chocolate caviar and raspberry sorbet .

The price was n't cheap for dessert , but if you take into account the entire experience and compared it to what you pay for drinks at a bar or lounge , it 's pretty comparable actually .
They also told me that they plan on introducing a new tea set menu during the day , so stay tune !

I saw dive - buddy 's and even professional dive masters pushing and encouraging novice divers to extend their limits in order to dive to that spectacular wreck or enter that mysterious cave when they simply do not have the appropriate training for it .
The bottom line is : get as much out of your diving experiences as you can , but stay safely within your own boundaries set by your personal education and practice .

The main precaution measure was purely judging the turbidity of the water , and this false practice has remained ever since , even nowadays .
It took years for people to recognize that their sense of smell and vision were not reliable judges of water quality .
Unlike the past , where people have little knowledge about sanitation and hygiene , with better scientific understanding and public education , people learn to think and evaluate the quality of the water that they are drinking and using every day .

People of all ages and cultures eating there .
The restaurants ' slogan is " positive eating " and they definitely live out that phrase .
The large dining room with a high ceiling is what catches everybody 's eye , especially when you set foot into the restaurant for the first time .

It is known that gossip magazines are bought by lots of people who are interested in what these people do , the kind of clothes they wear , or even the tattoos they have .

In the case of politicians , I do n't mind what they do in their holidays , for example , if they work properly when they should .
I think the Royal Family is an exception because they are supported by all the citizens , so I think we ( as citizen ) have the right to know everything they do if we want .
It happens that one day a friend of mine took me to a Film Club session .

Yes , that 's true that the car is far more convenient than public transport .
When you 're driving your own car you getting a lot of comfort .
And you never , ever , will come into contact with other people .
You do n't have wait till it arrives and it is never late .

People would say that travelling on public transport is the future for our lives .
But in truth there is no future at all for it , as our lives nowadays are becoming more and more demanding in terms of multitasking , goal seekers and family conciliation .
Public transport offers a range of timetables for trains , buses or metro , but when it comes to dealing with the day - to - day tasks , we very often find travelling by our own car is the easiest way .

Before the concert started , me and my co - workers had to clean the stage , set up the equipment and make sure everything works well : the sound , the lighting and the instruments .
I found that people consider sailing either a very boring sport , or a very dangerous one ;
Sailing is all about cooperation , and to really enjoy it one needs to do it regularly , to be able get to know the crew and find the most suitable role on the deck .
Being a good sailor does n't mean knowing all about it , the point of sails , the winds , and so on . For me , a good sailor is someone that knows the boat s / he 's sailing on , and is able to deal with all the possible situations and also the kinds of people s / he can possibly have to deal with .

Not always car is much more convenient . For example , in a big city it is far more convenient to use the underground than a car during the rush hour .
When we use public transport , we can read a newspaper or book and when we driving a car it 's impossible .
Also , go on holidays by car can be very convenient .

I was very disappointed because I did not do any of these things during the vacations .
As aliens did n't kidnap me I did not travel all around the galaxy during this vacations week .
Indeed , what I did in vacation was sleep the whole day , hang out with my " Unfamous " friends and write and compose two and a half songs .

Most people love donating money to different charities , but have you ever thought why it gives us such pleasure ? I believe it 's because , as humans , when we see someone happy , it makes us happy , especially if we are the reason for that happiness .
Is it the poor , homeless children in your country or the starving people in Africa , or is it some cancer organizations ?
Then I look for the diseases which the scientists are currently working on finding their cure .
This makes me realize that even if I have a disease , as hard as it is , I 'm still better than others and I 'm grateful .
To sum up , I believe more people should start donating to the uncommon charity organisations ; to the ones who need more help .
We should all be thankful we are what we are , because we could be a lot worse .

The majority of patients that has had general anaesthetic , like Mr. Sharma , must recover in a PACU ( Post - anaesthesia Care Unit ) to monitor the vital signs , especially the airways management due to the anaesthesia , impeding any postoperative complication ( Scoot , 2012 ; Farrell & Dempsey , 2011 ) .
The first 24 hours post surgery is considered the most critical period , because the patient can present , primarily , lung disorders , and the nurse need to maintain cardio - respiratory stability ( Popov & Peniche , 2009 ) .

Due to the surgery , Mr Sharma is in a supine position , but this position reduces his oxygenation ( Snowball , 2012 ) , and can also impede the air passage that is related to the anaesthesia effect , where the tongue and the lower jaw fall backward .
Therefore , the oxygen therapy needs to continue immediately along with his admission , via nasal cannula or oxygen mask within 4 to 6L / min , until the anaesthesia effects are completely gone and the patient 's oxygen saturation be restored ( Farrell & Dempsey , 2010 ) .
Thus , Mr. Sharma is being given O2 via Hudson mask 6L / min , because he received general anaesthesia and all of his muscles are relaxed and , at the moment , he do not have control over his reflexes ( Farrell & Dempsey , 2010 ) .
To help with this issue , the nurse should make certain that Mr. Sharma is comfortable , and elevate the head of the bed for a more upright position in order to facilitate and increase his oxygenation , helping him to recover his respiratory instability faster ( Snowball , 2012 ) .

The sport that I like the most is dancing .
It may sound weird or even wrong for some people , because there are many that do n't even consider dancing as a sport ... but for me , and for everyone that has ever done dancing , it is not only a sport , but a very difficult one .
However , I would advise people who would like to start dancing to really take it seriously , because even though I said it is fun , it really does require commitment and discipline .

Modern times have raised the concern about the environment , climate change and energy .
In the recent years , there has been a great change in consumption habits .
Now days , people can choose the most convenient way of travelling and there is no doubt that using a private car is easy , cheap and fun .

While the hyper - sexualisation of our society may be a reality that many parents would want to protect their children from , it is true to say that children need to adapt and be ready for the society in which they live and for many parents , sending their children to a mixed - sex school is just a natural environment , much more similar to the " outside world " in which they would grow to adulthood .
Considering how much time children spend at school , it appears to me that choosing a single - sex school will make the child , somehow , segregated and , in many cases , reinforce some of the many stereotypes that we , as a society , have regarding gender . Therefore , if we take into consideration that these children are going to be the future leaders , educators , lawyers , politicians and so on , I would argue that the more schools reflect our society and the way that we like it to be , the better , not only for the child as a person , but for the child as a key to the future of the country and , to an extent , to the world .

Therefore , and to sum up , It is my view , that public money is better spent supporting mixed - sex schools , which reflects the society we live in , as opposed to single - sex schools , which may reinforce those stereotypes that are undermining society .
I absolutely agree with this statement . Travelling by car is not only much more convenient than public transport , it also grants one 's independence to go wherever and whenever one might wish .
I consider myself to be ideally suited for this job for several reasons .

Some assert that genetically modified food technology can be applied to address this problem .
This essay will argue that genetically modified food can be the way out of the problem of food deficit and this will be done by focusing on its environmental benefits and increased food yield .
It is well known that GM food is inserted with various resistance genes , such as pest disease resistance gene .
Due to the various new traits resulting from the GM technology , such as drought tolerance and salinity tolerance , GM food can ensure the food production in a period of drought .
Actually , thousands of tests on GM food , before bringing it onto the markets , have been proven that it is harmless to both the environment and human health .

40% of the girls read books several hours a day , while 13% of the male students do n't read in their free time at all .
For example , 53% of the female students are online more than 3 hours a day .
If any conclusions may be drawn from the data , they are as follows .
There is an obvious tendency towards a decline in the active ways of spending free time .

Anyway , those tribes would not even need or want an education or a world language because it is their way of life to live in groups together with the nature and disturbing these cultural groups would simply be unnecessary .
On the other hand , the suggestion of English as the worldwide spoken language might be up against a lot of criticism , since the United States do not have many supporters everywhere .
Is it really that the end of public transport is soon to come ?
The cost of having a car is hence not as cheap as we think if we also take into account those unavoidable extra cost .

Here we have brand products and no - name products .
Now the question is , whether it is really justified that brand products are much more expensive than no - name products .
Most people associate brand products automatically with higher quality or better taste , while they think no - name products are just cheap and without any quality and poor taste .
In surveys , it was asked if consumers would rather buy brand products or no - name products .

Our specie has achieved great things , but despite all the great discoveries , there is still one problem we have not been able to solve , a problem that has been haunting us since time immemorial : racism .

This statement fails to consider the main function of education , which is not training superstars or perfect robots but teaching students how to face and solve the problems they are confronted instead of running away .
Among the various purposes of education , in my opinions , the most important one is teaching students to solve problems .
Confronting the challenging instead of turning aside , trying to think of possible solutions instead of giving up at the beginning , always being positive about the unknown instead of negative and retreating . All these are the main reason why humankind can keep improving .
Transferring this knowledge and experiences to young people is the meaning of education .

For some people , living a life which enable them do what they like and like what they are doing is enough to be considered as a successful life .
They might not be the best , but they are self - actualized and satisfied , and only in such a situation can they provide most to the world , just like Albert Einstein has said , " Try not to become a man of success but rather to become a man of value . "
Considering all the above , I can not agree with the statement that persuading students not to pursue fields of study in which they have less possibility to be successful is the responsibility of the educational institutions .
In my opinion , the purpose of education is to teach and guide students how to face problems and make their own decision properly , not force them to accept what has already been arranged for them .

Upstairs , there would be a games room where I could play with my nephews , nieces and my daughter , another bathroom , a little office to work and to study English , and finally , a huge room called " the cinema - room " , with several comfortable seats and a giant screen where my friends and I could see our favourite films .

Not only does River Boat Disco has its own experienced DJ , but it also has a buffet which is more than suitable for this occasion .

All in all , I think this would be the best restaurant for our class to go , since it 's close to the school , it has good prices and a friendly ambience .
