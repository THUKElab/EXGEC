public transportation has been more used by people and over the years it has been kind of becoming cheaper and also more safe but some people prefer cars . To what extent do we agree with this and what are our reasons for that that is what are we going to demonstrate in this essay

nowadays all facilities of travelling are more convenient from cars to buses even trains and planes .some people prefer cars because they do not like crowded places or because they find it cheaper sometimes , but from another point of view public transportation is very cheap and even faster but when it comes to traveling a lot of people prefer driving their own cars to feel the real experience and to enjoy themselves more by avoiding crowded places
to summaries it is different from some oneis opinion to another i predict that public transportation will be improved and people will use it more and more that in the end cars will disappear and will no longer be used

In conclusion , I have offered two important advice for visitors that come to my country : Try to get alone with your companion in order to have fun and try to enjoy Mexican food because it is delicious !

In conclusion , the benefits from using Facebook and Twitter are that people can communicate and be connected to their friends frequently .

but all these factors are not important for me .
However , you will have to spend a considerable amount of money in it and you will not be guaranteed to achieve your goals at all so it could become a real nightmare if you do not focus on your learning tasks .
I think this is the best restaurant to go to on the end of the course , so we could book some tables as soon as possible because a lot of people usually go there .

Puerquitour : A great experience to your mouth .
I arrived at Mexico City one month ago and I met an old friend from high school , Vicente .
The first day started in an important date … Taco Day !
Due to Puerquitour is something to share , the second day we shared it with Diana , one of my friends from Vancouver .

If you do n't start studying before the exam with an appropriate time , you will only have enough time to know the broad outlines of the subject , but this will never help you soak up the details and understand the concepts lying behind every single word .
Since I had practiced a lot and memorized that concept before many times , I was able to remember it .
It is a city that keeps its history through : amazing architecture like balconies , churches like San Francisco Church which has mysterious subterranean catacombs ; el Real Felipe which is the last incredible Spanish fortress ; through their costumes as well as the Carnival . On this day you can enjoy this particular , interesting and colorful festival because you use water , paint or talc to wet your family and neighbors . Through their traditional dance called " La Marinera " . They also keep their history through religion where you discover the religious enthusiasm which is represented by la Procesión del Señor de los Milagros ; their gastronomy is another extraordinary and wonderful example about their symbols , like Mazamorra Morada , el Pisco Sour wine , el Ceviche , los Picarones , etc .
Additionally , if you open a savings account in that bank , you will get a diary as a gift .
All in all , I would recommend you to open your first savings account in the Phone Bank , since the rate of interest is higher and you do n't need to pay any annual charges .

Stephen Belcher , director of the Met Office 's Hadley Centre , claims that humanity is to blame for climate changes like the rise of temperature or the catastrophe expected by scientists when global warming rises beyond 2C. This opinion is also represented by the British Secretary of energy and climate change , Amber Rudd , who considers climate change to be one of the greatest problems in politics nowadays , due to its consequences for the economy , global security and the fight against poverty .
She stands up for a global deal confirmed on the UN summit by the leading states and therefore these climate targets should be a role - model for other countries .
Global warming in general leads to more natural disasters as flooding , heatwaves , water shortages and loss of harvests .
Another advantage for a site to being inscribed on the List is that once a country signs the Convention , and has sites inscribed on the World Heritage List ; the resulting prestige often helps raise awareness among citizens and governments for heritage preservation .
Moreover they remain in the list of sites in danger without receiving assistance .
In my opinion the sites in danger unless they do not meet the ten criteria should be protect for UNESCO .
I started playing cricket since my early childhood .
One day in the future another Franz Ferdinand could be killed , and that symbolic event could serve again as an escuse for some country to declare war to another , but the true underlying causes that actually led the countries to wage war against each other would have their roots in much older times .
